It would help if you (and anyone else asking for medical information on
some subject) could ask specific questions, as no one is likely to type
in a textbook chapter covering all aspects of the subject.  If you are
looking for a comprehensive review, ask your local hospital librarian.
Most are happy to help with a request of this sort.

 President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President 
Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:

1:36 P.M. EDT

     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal
agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law
against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled
weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.
Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day
standoff ensued.

     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every
reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without
bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were
ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were
dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably
insane.

     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both
federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,
responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the
action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination
towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no
provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal
agents against the compound.

     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on
an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on
Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.
The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even
in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause
permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people
in the compound to come outside and to surrender.

     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I
discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I
thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what
she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the
implementation of the decision.

     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.
Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal
agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his
captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not
survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate
responsibility for the carnage that ensued.

     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the
future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and
Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to
uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been
dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent
professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I
expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required
to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to
cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can
continue to be fully accountable to the American people.

     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney
General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the
front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult
circumstances.

     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry
for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end
of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be
tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David
Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over
the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult
situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will
be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future
will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what
has been learned now.

     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,
after 51 days, you decided --

     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is
that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation
with --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go
first and then the other.

     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I
can't do it at once.

     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about
the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General
that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another
step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she
described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted
to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause
permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it
very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was
hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.

     I was further told that under no circumstances would our
people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to
shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and
there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful
lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.
There were no shots coming back from the government side.

     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I
asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons
I was given were the following:

     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the
federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the
quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be
needed in other parts of the country.

     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had
never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced
that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to
be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult
members to come out.

     Number three, that the danger of their doing something
to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with
the passage of time.

     And number four, that they had reason to believe that
the children who were still inside the compound were being abused
significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and
unsafe conditions.

     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.
The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had
given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and
evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said
that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were
convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only
increase with the passage of time.

     The third question I asked was, has the military been
consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,
that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious
that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military
people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some
of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the
military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they
had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one
minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military
-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming
significance.

     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I
said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she
should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that
today.

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.

     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --
reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were
trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only
reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only
reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to
add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather
late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who
had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into
custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events
to unfold.

     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people
speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General
on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.
I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry
King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it
is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that
happen when the federal government is in control.

     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised
would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the
Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics
murdered themselves.  (Applause.)

     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this
life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These
people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were
heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,
and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to
avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate
themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the
children.

     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,
is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you
to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why
you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she
said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those
children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly
unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier
with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for
that.  So that is where I think things stand.

     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was
mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of
patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really
decide that way?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume
is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has
done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of
time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the
World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry
to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we
should have known?  Is there some other question they should have
asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say
for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make
the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want
the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have
some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but
totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best
evidence we have.

     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of
fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it
again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,
particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is
important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the
people who killed others and then killed themselves.

     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options
presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from
February 28th until yesterday?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all
along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go
back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good
job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued
any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them
early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of
the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to
be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the
authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things
just began to spin downward.

     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened
yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not
involve other options except whether we should take more time with
the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they
wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get
people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.
That's what they thought.

     Q  Did the government know that the children did not
have gas masks?

     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are
you in agreement with that?

     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do
whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the
Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring
in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any
congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully
cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the
most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the
country.

No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't
lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.

>...Even a simpleton knows that

Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much
more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the
threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger
using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim 
in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not
be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually
_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)
It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a
knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more
common. That's why it is important to look at the overall
(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of
substitution, different criminal techinques of using different
weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.

>As for knives, see my earlier post.  I'd much rather face a knife
>than a gun, thanks.  

""Face""? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't
too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the
usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts
to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your
pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun
than actually stabbed with a knife.

Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in
unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman 
without much problem.

You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime
Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a
knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives
in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost
all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,
using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)
a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless
of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective
than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a ""serious threat""
nearly as often as they do guns.

                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE

[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- 
and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with 
the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]

Dear Adrian:  

I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to 
your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and 
generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist 
mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back 
with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present 
now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the 
future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  

There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger 
of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 
10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, 
shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic 
rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll 
limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent 
with your note.  

First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't 
alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my 
interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  

Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't 
support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions 
anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older 
body of lies, omissions, and distortions.  

Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on 
countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND 
BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this 
present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.  

Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat 
(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you 
should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in 
designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our 
ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree 
on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 
years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.  
More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s 
clearly indicate the contrary.  

Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human 
behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far
too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The 
attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the 
resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  

Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates 
figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but 
basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social 
benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a 
criminal offense.  

Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials 
quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are 
many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless 
because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it 
wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that 
anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, 
whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's 
permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists 
themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed 
people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".  
Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity"" 
viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, 
ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in 
the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, 
and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we 
probably manufacture at least that many every year.

The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly 
aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what 
their real motives are.  

Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, 
it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; 
the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the 
self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing 
this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a 
quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life"" 
of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna 
be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.

As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law 
provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I 
will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is 
that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands 
-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can 
only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given 
both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics 
and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  

So what's the point?

Once again, the Rockies bullpen fell apart.  Andy Ashby pitched six (somewhat
shaky) innings giving up just one run.  Then game the dreaded relief.  Three
picthers combined to give up 3 runs (one each I believe) in the 7th inning
and blew the save opportunity.  (Final was 4-2 vs Expos).

Despite their problems in the pen, I think the Rockies are a team that wont
be taken lightly.  Going into today's game, the had the league's leading
hitter and RBI man (Galarraga), two of the leaders in stolen bases (Young
and Cole) and increasingly strong starting pitching.

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for
argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below
expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I
tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but
I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are
any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can
look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  

Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although
there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was
given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what
you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the
next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at
age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,
and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was
performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed"";
Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have
been less likely to give up on him.

Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts
performing up to expectations?

Whatabout, Schools, Universities, Rich Individuals (around 250 people 
in the UK have more than 10 million dollars each). I reecieved mail
from people who claimed they might get a person into space for $500
per pound. Send a skinny person into space and split the rest of the money
among the ground crew!

Agreed. I volunteer for any UK attempts. But one clause: No launch methods
which are clearly dangerous to the environment (ours or someone else's). No
usage of materials from areas of planetary importance.

>Any other ideas??

Yes: We should *do* this rather than talk about it. Lobby people!
The major problem with the space programmes is all talk/paperwork and
no action!

Hmmm... I hadn't heard about rockets. ATF must be escalating their

Why should they have ""done something""? The Davidians had not attacked
or even threatened anyone.

>What possible use would a religious cult have for a rocket launcher?

It is not yours nor the governments right to tell others what they have
a legitimate right to own.

>Also, is child abuse covered by the Bill of Rights?

Is child abuse now within the jurisdiction of the department of the
treasury? Attacking citizens without due process on the strength of
unsubstantiated rumors about a violation of a law which does not
fall under your jurisdiction is a pretty serious breech of rights.

I basically agree, the Tigers are my favorite team.  Actually, their
pitching might actually be better this year than last (not that htat's
saying a hole lot). How 'bout that home opener on Tuesday!! By the way,
Sparky goes for win 2,000 today.

All they said on the radio that he developed stiffness in the shoulder
after throwing a curveball that didn't loosen.  Because of the cold
night in Denver they decided to remove him from the game rather than
let him pitch.  He is expected to pitch his next turn in the rotation
(expected to be April 20, at Shea vs the Giants).

As for SF and advertising in space. There is a romantic episode
in Mead's ""The Big Ball of Wax"" where the lovers are watching 
the constellation Pepsi Cola rising over the horizon and noting
the some 'stars' had slipped cause the Teamsters were on strike.

This was the inspiration for my article on orbiting a formation
of space mirrors published in Spaceflight in 1986. As the reviews
said: this seems technically feasible, and could be commercially viable
but is it aesthetically desirable?  These days the only aesthetics
that count are the ones you can count!

I don't know if it's as much an issue of their ablility to handle the

However, if you encounter a '93 Formula with 5.7L & 6-Speed Manual,
You'll be SOL, I'm afraid. ;) BTW, I know of what I speak as a former

Oh no!  Someone is provided useful information AND mentioned that they

uninformed speculation by people trying to sell their personal stuff
(from houses to dead pcs) at a huge markup/trying to unload stuff they

The net is not ""supposed"" to be a dumping ground for free ads, but
reserving it for tripe doesn't seem to be a significant improvement.

>In addition to improper etiquette, this product is a mailing list
>used for generating junk mail.  

So?  Either they target it well enough to pay for it, in other words,
they manage to send it to people who want the stuff (in which case it
is junk only for the ""rest"" and the transaction costs are borne
appropriately in this case) or they go bankrupt.  Seems fair to me.

>Am I correct in assuming this is improper, and if so, what can be

You could hold your breath.  You could kill offending messages as
they come onto your machine and refuse to send them any further,
but not until you turn blue.

Sandberg is not particulary known for his stolen bases.  What competition did 
Alomar have?  Sandberg came in a year after Ripken, and the same year as Boggs,
Gwynn, and the other magicians.  So less attention was given to Sandberg. 
Alomar is the only one in his class to be worth a mediocre.  Besides the 
numbers don't count.  National league pitchers are much better pitchers.

That's very true.  I live in Richmond, home of the AAA Richmond
Braves, and they have this guy Ryan Klesko who hit 17 HR's at home
last year.  Now that doesn't sound like a whole lot, BUT the way the
""Diamond"" is built, Home runs are a rarity.   In fact, Ron Gant,
Brian Hunter and David Justice all proved they could hit in
Richmond.  When they were sent to the majors, they never came back.
If you can hit in Richmond, you can hit anywhere.  

So far, after beating Scranton (Phillies) 9-0 in the first game, the
best team in AAA history has been rather underwhelming.  Too many
expectations I guess.

This has me thinking.  Is there a biological reason why women can't put

back of each of my pants.  I put my keys in one and wallent in another.
Many of the pockets even have a botton on them so I can close them securely.
Everything is that much simpler for me.  Why can't women do the same?
Is is biological (ie, not enough room for a bigger bottom plus keys and
a wallet) or is it the way they are raised by the parents?

My husband woke up three days ago with a small sore spot
(a spot about the size of a nickel) on one of his testicles. Bottom side,
no knots or lumps, just a little sore spot.  He says it reminds him of 
how a bruise feels.  He has no recollection of hitting it or anything like
that that would cause a bruise. (He asssures me he'd remember something
like that :-) 

Any clues as to what it might be?  He's somewhat of a hypochondriac (sp?)
so he's sure he's gonna die. . .

Thanks!!

Time once again to clean out the ol' closet.  Some stuff is up for offers, some
isn't.  Please read carefully.


In the MAKE OFFER department:

	WordPerfect 5.0, upgrade copy.  Includes all disks and all upgrade
	manuals.  Best offer.

	Balance of Power, 1992 edition, for the Amiga.  With manual and reg.
	card.  Best offer.


In the FOR SALE department:

	Technics model 715 auto-reverse open-reel STEREO tape deck.  Because
	it's auto-reverse, this deck records onto tape just like a cassette
	deck does, so it's not very good for splice-type editing.  However,
	I have used it effectively in ""tape studio"" applications for mastering,
	and it works great.  3.75 and 7.5 ips speeds, supports up to 7"" reels.
	Dual lighted VU meters with record indicators.  Full auto-reverse
	capable (and the mechanism works, too!).  Adjustable sound on sound,
	and socket for remote control (I don't know where you'd find one, but
	they used to make 'em), plus a 110VAC unswitched outlet.  This unit
	is in excellent condition and I have had it rebuilt once since I got
	it--works perfectly.

	Price:  $225.00 or best offer, or possible trade (see below).


	Panasonic KX-P1624 printer.  24-pin with 360x360dpi resolution in both
	text and graphics modes.  Warranty cards, manuals, all the usual stuff
	you expect when buying like-new merchandise.  I'm selling it because I
	now have a better printer.  This is the wide carriage version of the
	KX-P1124, by the way.  Test prints are available upon request.

	Price:  $250.00 o.b.o. or trade.


	Excalibur custom pool cue.  19 oz., 13 mm, brass joint, Irish linen
	wrap, could use a new tip but will hold up for a while.  I've got too
	many cues as it is, and don't need this one.  Hits nicely, is very
	straight and in excellent condition.

	Price:  $125.00 o.b.o. or trade.  Imperial hard case (1 butt/1 shaft)
	available for an additional $40.00.


TRADES:  I need the following things, and I have no cash of my own right now,
so if you want to trade, it needs to be straight-across.   The list:

	Amiga ROM upgrade to at LEAST 2.04, preferably 2.1+, with appropriate
	DOS and Workbench.

	1 meg Agnus chip for the Amiga.

	Amiga hard drive and controller (preferably SCSI).

	IBM-compatible hard drive (and controller if not MFM).  This one's 
	touchy, as I have a full-height and don't have room for more unless
	I swap out--needs to be above 100M, and I will consider trading a
	good ST-4096 in the deal.

	Intel 9600EX or 14.4EX or similar EXTERNAL high-speed modem.


This is not a complete list, but it's close.  If you've got something way off
the track of this list, it's probably not going to interest me at this point.
Email responses, please.

Neither.  Again I was merely addressing the sanity level of the players.  
I agree that the BATF handled the affair badly from day one.  BTW, I heard 
on the news today that the affadavit behind the no-knock warrant was unsealed 
today.  Grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that I found 
unusual.

Ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an Australian 
in 1992 on the compound grounds to help identify survivors.  I, for one, 
will check their stories for consistency with what I learned in a long 
news story about that documentary.

Certainly there is some room for doubt.  I certainly reserve the right 
to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change.  If I 
were conspiratorially minded, however, I would never be able to change 
my mind, because any evidence I disliked would have to be a lie

Keywords: bbb arbitration lemon
Lines: 46


My BBB Autoline arbitration experience is over.  
The outcome was decidedly mixed.  I won the battle but 
lost the war.  The arbitrator found that the car was 
defective, but decided to offer a repurchase well below 
market value :(.  At the time of the hearing, average 
retail on my truck in the NADA book was $21,025, but 
the decision was for  $17,665.  I wrote a letter to the 
Council of Better Business Bureaus pointing out the 
fact that if you have an automobile that does not 
depreciate rapidly, the manufacturer has no incentive 
to deal with you.  There is no way that the 
manufacturer can loose because they can turn around and 
sell the vehicle at a profit if the consumer is awarded 
a repurchase.  The attitude of Chevrolet's 
representative at the hearing tends to support this 
point of view;  he was totally unprepared and did not 
seem to take the proceeding very seriously.

I decided to take the repurchase, even though I am 
getting totally screwed on the price.  I will not have 
to deal with continuing repairs or selling a lemon 
myself, and I have no case for a civil suit based on 
the Idaho lemon law.  I am planning to send a letter to 
my elected representatives telling them how utterly 
ridiculous the Idaho lemon law is.  The law allows for 
a ""use deduction"" equal to the IRS mileage allowance.  
As if Chevrolet were buying my gas and paying 
for my insurance.

Summary of the case:  In May 1992 I bought a new 3/4 ton
HD Chevrolet pickup.  Between May 1992 and December 1992 
this vehicle required repair after repair.  Systems 
that required attention included the transmission, 
heater fan, paint, suspension, and motor.  The main 
problem was the five speed manual transmission.  They 
could not install a non-defective transmission in at 
least four attempts.

So, in summary, it is possible to get a repurchase, but 
you are going to get screwed on the price, unless you 
paid too much in the first place, or if your car 
happens to be a model that depreciates rapidly.

No, the neiseria meningococcus is one of the most common
forms of meningitis.  It's the one that sometimes sweeps
schools or boot camp.  It is contagious and kills by attacking
the covering of the brain, causing the blood vessels to thrombose
and the brain to swell up.

It is very treatable if caught in time.  There isn't much time,
however.  The rash is the tip off.  Infants are very susceptible
to dying from bacterial meningitis.  Any infant with a fever who
becomes stiff or lethargic needs to be rushed to a hospital where
a spinal tap will show if they have meningitis.  Seizures can also
occur.

It can live in the throat of carriers.  Don't worry, you won't get 
it from them, especially if they took the medication.

Also, Alomar got a FAR greater boost from his home park than Baerga did from 
his. And ""six or seven home runs""? Hmm.

So, if you wanted to pick a second baseman to play in Toronto, you'd take 
Alomar. Anywhere else, and you'd probably take Baerga.

Sounds more like an Opel GT.  Neat cars, fun to drive.  Sold through
Buick from 196? through 1973 (if I remember correctly).  I believe it
was in '72 that there were some engine mods made such that parts
were not interchangeable with the older models.  Parts are thus much
harder to come by for the later models.  Parts in general are not
too difficult to find.  At one time JC Whitney carried some stuff
including a brand new (not remfg) long block.  Either a GT or a
Kharman Ghia (hmm that spelling looks hosed) will be my next project.

Well, I've driven in every state but Alaska, and drive about 60k per year.
I take long cross country trips any chance I get - its fun for me and I
can get reimbursment.
My job allows me to drive rather than fly. Not to labor the point, but
I've driven just about every freewayin the US, Germany, UK and France plus
some in Mexico, which was surpisingly good.

Yes, but as a %age of the total freeway in the US? 
All you have to do in this case is mark the hazard, advising people to

Given the absence of other traffic and car built for 130 (e.g. 535)

Hi, everyone;


I need an advice on what is the best way to get a scumster.

Several weeks ago I posted an article on behalf of a friend who wanted
an external HD for mac. The scumster - R.E.P. - called my friend and
they agreed on a price. My friend (unexperienced and not too fluent in
English) paid by check, requesting R.E.P. to call him back when the check
arrives and the HD is send. Well, the check was cashed 3/24 and that is
that. Phone # that R.E.P. gave is on the answering machine all the time
and there is no reaction when the message is left; e-mail address does not
bounce but again there is no answer. I know, that R.E.P. is a student at
University of Delaware; I have his e-mail address, his US postal address
and his (?) phone#. The question is: WHAT IS THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Sincerely,
Victor Levenson (VVL2H@virginia.edu)

P.S. The reason I did not put R.E.P.'s full name is that I still hope...


P.P.S. If I get enough responses I will post a summary, maybe even on a

I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no
idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to
release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,
Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out
a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad,
and excruciatingly prolonged.)

I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to
give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting
so gloomy?

No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when
the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.

Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which
was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.
Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a
six-year free agent before the 1992 season.

>9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.

Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.

But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life
of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.

>11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.

But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his
disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign
him.

He certainly wasn't last year.

Hey, that's the ""Skates Smith"" package deal.  Anybody who acquires
Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is
a real weirdo.

If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer
gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or
hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.

It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them
to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think
bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for
John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch
last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something
in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement
parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to
the Bucs' future.

Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I

this?

I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to
blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I
*seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his
willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is
pointed at his feet.

(btw--I've wondered whether my latest posts have been getting

I suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority....

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and 
one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent 
assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems
like heart attack and stroke.

'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans
using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some
may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in 
using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.
(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, 
but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage
if anything is low.)

At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred 
to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group 
can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might 
support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.

Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half
of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.

The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  These
are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a
three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the
earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without
expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible"". The
originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan
was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for
deceleration.

	This from an issue of 'Science News' or 'The Planetary Report' I
believe, about 2 months ago(?).

	The runner can leave his base at any time.  If the ball is caught,
he's got to tag up.  If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at
all.  So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up.  If it isn't caught, he's probably scored
a run.  If it is, he's probably headed for AAA.  

	The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out,
thereby removing the force on the runners on base.  All other rules apply,
as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.

Yes, absolutely, though I'd make the observation in a more general sense of
all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various
biases. 

But here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back, once again, 
to equating the business of science with the end result, the gizmo produced.

My point isn't so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but *how* 
you come about developing it.

Perhaps you'd admit that this is an oversimplification on your part (the topic
of the philosophy of science is made for them, I'm making them too) but I
think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the 
business of doing science.  Biomedical research doesn't make any basic 
assumptions that aren't the same as any other discipline of scientific
research.  That is, that you make empirical observations, form an hypothesis
and test it.  Modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than 
""the old Newtonian model of the world"".  And I doubt that many psychologists
would appreciate being put outside this empirical ""world view"".  Psychology
also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending. 

>It is also important to distinguish reason from science. Science may be

Oversimplified, of course, but a good example.  This is an empirical observa-
tion.  It was then tested, though perhaps not by Aristotle, and eventually 
found wanting.  In the meantime, some folk will 
have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life.  
There's nothing at all surprising about this, it's the way the gathering of
knowledge works.  There are probably more than a few things in my own 
discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off-base,
even idiotic, to someone in the future.  These future people won't have come
to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all Zen-like and had 
a vision in an LSD trip.  Someone will have thought of something new and 
tested it.  This is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting
science and research can't seem to wrap their minds around.  Science is a 
creative process.  What I think of as factual and good research can be totally
turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories.  

Again, I think it gets down to defining what you mean by ""science"".  I often
don't recognize what it is that I do, and am involved in, in the way science
is portrayed by popular media or writings of people in the humanities.  They
portray science as a collection of immutable facts, pronouncements of TRUTH
in big gold letters.  That's silly.  Its as though we just go into the lab,
turn over a stone, and come up with a mechanism for transcriptional regula-
tion.  Its much more interesting than that.  It really is a very human
process.

I've already corrected my mistake earlier in this thread.  I saw a brief 
news report which led to the above inaccuracy.  I have since seen detailed 
summaries that show the tanks returned in the late morning.

So, why didn't the BD's leave when the gas was first introduced much 
earlier in the morning?  Didn't they care about the children?

Why didn't they release the children weeks ago?

Hello netters!

I'm visiting the US (I'm from Sweden) in August. I will probably rent a Chevy
Beretta from Alamo. I've been quoted $225 for a week/ $54 for additional days. 
This would include free driving distance, but not local taxes (Baltimore). 
They also told me all insurance thats necessary is included, but I doubt that,
 'cause a friend rented a car last year and it turned out he needed a lot more
insurance than what's included in the base price. But on the other hand he didn't
rent it from Alamo.

Does anyone have some info on this?

Is $225 a rip-off? 
Probability that I'll be needing more insurance?
Is the beretta a good rental car?

Thanx

Markus

The 1941 Lincoln Continental was the first car to sport the ""continental
kit."" The continental kit is not to be confused with ye olde outside
mounting bracket; a continental kit is a very specific ornament/storage
compartment. (The 1941 Continental has a neat trunk; it looks rather

  Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact
that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much
of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the
industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired
and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point
where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that
the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,
Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  ""When it's time to railroad,
you railroad.""

  Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.
However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the

merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be

  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a
Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations
can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),
Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in
1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were
within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well
within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only
a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.
  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by
taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane
that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions
asked.

Let's see... April 15th... less than 30 at bats.... and you claim that he 
hasn't done too much so far!

Cut this guy some slack. Danny will produce this year. It's scary to think
just how much he'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year.

The Yanks have a lot going for them this year: good starting rotation, good
bullpen, good defense and a good lineup. Also, I like Buck Showalter. Frank
Howard on 1st is also a good move. Everything sounds good so far. 

If the Yanks stay healthy, they have a good chance at winning the pennant. This 
is the most fun I've had watching the Yanks since ""78!

You all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees
all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the
expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.

The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised
anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the
Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in
June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins
dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.

Okay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive
calculation, I thought this did pretty well.

Except for the Brewers (who you probably forgot), you were right!  The
rest of the division was thoroughly mediocre.  The Yankees and Indians
""led"" with 76 wins, the Red Sox ""trailed"" with 73 wins.  None were
horrible, but four were five or more games below .500.

I don't think I want to wait that long.  But they won 89 games last

Looks like it.  He wasn't bad last year, just too consistent to be an

Belle hit 34 HR last year, walking 52 times (but five of those were

How much did Cal sign for?  When did he sign?  If I remember

Nobody is using discrete IC's to do these functions anymore if at

Well thank you dennis for your as usual highly detailed and informative 
posting.   

The question i have about the proton, is  could it be  handled at
one of KSC's spare pads, without major  malfunction,  or could it be
handled at kourou  or Vandenberg?   

Now if it uses storables,  then  how long would it take for the russians
to equip something at cape york?

If  Proton were launched from a western site,  how would it compare to the
T4/centaur?   As i see it, it should lift  very close to the T4.

I have become involved in a project to further develop and 
improve the performance of SPECT (Single Photon Emission
Computerized Tomography) imaging.  We will eventually have
to peddle this stuff somewhere, and so as I move this thing
along, I would like to know --

What is the current resolution of SPECT imaging?  What kinds
of jobs is SPECT used for, specifically?  What kind of specific jobs
could I hope
that SPECT could be used for, if its resolution improved,
say, to close to that of PET (Positron Emission Tomography)?
And how much does a SPECT machine cost?  How much does a single
SPECT image cost?  

If anyone knows the answer to any or all of these questions, OR
where I could find that answer, I would be very grateful, indeed.  
Thanks in advance for any replies

Does anyone know the particulars on the Senate File 303?
Does this bill allow or deny off-duty police from carrying concealed?

From what information that I have, Iowa has a discretionary permit policy
on CCW.  If S 303 allows police(off-duty) to carry concealed then I would
be inclined to oppose it.  I don't believe off-duty police officers should
have any more rights than civilians.  If law or policy prevents law-abiding
citizens from being armed for self defense then why should off-duty police
officer be treated any differently.

Never?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort
to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.

At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was
the chain was regarding the tanks ""last used in Detroit in 48"".
The text follows.

:  You did not merely claim that
: tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress
: sniper fire and that they were ""quite"" effective at this.  

Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say
I had been told they did fire their main guns.  
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: You continue to

Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks
post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  

: ""Well, it's not the main gun.""  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you
: now going to admit that you were wrong?

That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?
   --------------------------------------------------
  ""I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns
to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.""
   --------------------------------------------------

  I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're
paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own
eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps
people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,
""bullshit filters"".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.

  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:
  --------------------------------------------------
>We haven't used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948. 

Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it
was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions
it in his song ""Black Day in July"".
  --------------------------------------------------

  Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that
means I was right.  

: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67
: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place
: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American
: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have
: been *big* news.

   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  

Awesley goes on:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. 

: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been
: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about
: it. 

   Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an
authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it
had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an
authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged
massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.
Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but
the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also
heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
assert that I claimed they were truth.

: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. 

   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the 
difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 
years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.
So it would have been an Army cover-up.

   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building
were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and
am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.

: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer
: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that
: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.

   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe
that they did fire their guns.

   Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read
this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the
account I cited.

You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people 
have left the compound unharmed and alive earier in the standoff.

And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you 
can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the 
FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.

I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense.
You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this 
compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless 
to me.

I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't 
stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me 
sad and sick.

Have you ever heard of Jonestown?
The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority 
worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these 
people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot 
more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as 
last year.

==============================================================
Hi Folks;

Wednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening
statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,
each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.

The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to
Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the ""evil"" federal
government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal
agents ""sawed off"" shotguns and later failed to appear for
trial: Despite repeated ""good faith"" efforts to get Weaver
to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted
when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and
began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people
were taking an ""offensive action"" against an FBI helicopter
when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.

The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern
Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted
simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to
sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution
alleged, want to become a ""regular supplier"").  The defense also
argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when
he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,
but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist
angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The
failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given
an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.
The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed
Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver
then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal
agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,
there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:
However, agents were near the body for an extended period of
time and could have played with the select-fire - this will
have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims
that Vicki Weaver was only going to ""look at the body"" [not recover?]
of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.

Prosecution quote: ""Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made
that confrontation."" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist

Defense quote: ""The evidence in this case is going to show that
this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged
with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that
the government did commit.""  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]

Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters
heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests
outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate
again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including
""Tim"" again.  ""Tim"" claimed he was a skinhead, who were ""ordinary,
working class people.""  He also claimed he was for ""white pride,
not white power.""

Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview
with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly
what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.

In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about
a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the
courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence
in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some
tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent
were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they
believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,
repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the
defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the
recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the ""sawed
off"" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another
good one!).

Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to
begin presenting evidence.

Later on, the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some
of the worst pseudo-scientific shows in TV history by flying ""Into Infinity.""
This was a one-off thing done as part of BBC's ""educational SF"" series ""The
Day After Tomorrow."" The Anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of
reaching the speed of light (""lightship Altares""), the four-man crew eventually 
journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy (I
think). I saw this as a 9-year-old back in 1976 and liked it very much, but
then again I was a fan of SPACE:1999 so I guess I was easily satisfied in those
days:-)
---
Does anyone know if ""Into Infinity"" has been released on video? I have some
SPACE:1999 shows on VHS and know that Thunderbirds etc. also are available in
England.

Summary: query
Keywords: Saturn, Subaru, manual, automatic


The biggest hurdle for automatics (IMHO) is not shifting speed
per se, but rather the transmission's reaction speed when you
try to force it to shift manually.  

This was the biggest fault with the Subaru ECVT -- it took SOOOOOO
LONNNNNNNNGGGGG for the tranny to find the right ratio.

The sales propaganda says the Saturn automatic is effectively an
electronically-shifted manual.  Might this mean that Saturn has
conquered the problem?  (I dunno, only driven Saturn 5-speeds)

INPUT, PLEASE!

Another question:  Any plans for a manual-trans Chrysler LH?
Does anyone else out there fall asleep at night dreaming of this combo?

 Well, yes.  That was a part of my point.  Aspirin has its problems, but
in some situations it is useful.  Ditto stuff like licorice root.  Taking
anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea
of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted,
additional effects.  Taking any drug when the potential ill-effects are
not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved, and it may be that
in a given situation the risk is worthwhile.
   Like Prozac, for instance; Prozac has been shown to be theraputic in
some cases where the tri-cyclics fail.  But Prozac hasn't been in use
that long, and it really isn't clear what if any effects it may have
when taken over long periods of time, even though it has been tested
by present day standards.  Should Prozac be taken off the market because
long-term effects, if any, are not known?  IMHO, i'd say no.

Gun safety classes sound good in theory, but they kind of remind me of
the ""literacy tests"" used in the bad old days to keep blacks from voting.
They came with the ""grandfather clause"": if your grandfather could vote,
you could vote.  Sort of like the gun safety laws that only let the

	A friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically
every few months for the last 3 years.  An episode begins with extreme
tiredness followed by:

	1. traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows,
	knees, and hips.
	2. generalized muscle pains
	3. tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears
	4. severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day
	5. hemorrhaging in both eyes.  Her opthamologist calls it peripheral
   retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy.  (She
        isn't diabetic--they checked.
	6. distorted color vision and distorted vision in general (telephone
	   poles do not appear to be straight)
	7. loss of peripheral vision.
 	
	Many tests have been run and all are normal except for something 
called unidentified bright objects found on a MRI of her brain.  The only
thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone.  At
times she had been on 60 mg per day.  Whenever she gets down to 10-15 mg
the symptoms become acute again.

	She is quite concerned because the retinal hemorrhages are becoming
worse with each episode and her vision is suffering.  None of the docs she
has seen have any idea what this condition is or what can be done to stop
it.  Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in 
advance.  Kathy Turner

I don't think they provide homeopaths, heck the heir apparent was trying to 
promote Osteopaths to the ranks of eligibility a couple of years back... It 
pleased my family no end, since I'm at an Osteopathic school, sort of 
validated it for them...then I told them that the name was the same but the 
practice was different....oh.
	If you're seeking validation for your philosophy on the strength of 
the national health service adopting it, I suggest that you are not very 
sure of the validity of your philosophy. I believe in 1946, the NHS was 
still having its nurses taught the fine art of ""cupping"", which is the 
vacuum extraction of intradermal fluids by means of heating a cup, placing 
it on the afflicted site and allowing it to cool.
	I wouldn't take my sick daughter to a homeopath.

Sorry, but *neither* 'dictates' the cost. It's a negotiation.
Whether it's up front at a honda dealership in an all out 
dickering war, or more removed on a larger economic scale
(ie, if saturn can't sell at it's price, the price drops,
or the company stops building them), it remains a negotiated
value controlled by market forces. To think that the consumer 
controls price is ludicrous. If the consumer controled
price, then cars would be *free*...And no one would build 
cars.

The federal government has mandated that all passenger cars by model year
'95 return to the floor mounted dimmer switch.

A study by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has
found that an unacceptable percentage of after dusk collisions were the
direct result of unskilled drivers getting their left foot stuck in the
steering wheel :-)

Why do you think he would be called a quack?  The quacks don't do cultures.

I don't mean to be disrespectful to your concerns, but it seems to me 
that you're getting all wound up in a non-issue.  

As many knowledgeable people have pointed out, msg is a naturally 
occurring substance in a lot, if not most, foods.  When food 
manufacturers add it to a preparation, they do so because it's a 
known flavor enhancer. 

Your wife's theory, that MSG is added to food to stimulate appetite, 
may well be true.  But I don't believe it's ALWAYS the reason it's 
added.  People are (largely, for the most part) in charge of their 
own appetites.

Cats will Take Advantage of You.  Resign yourself:  you will never

I also suspect, though it's been a while since I've checked ingredients 
on commercial cat food, that there are much more stringent requirements 
on pet food additives than human.  

See, the FDA has this stupid idea that human beings have the intelligence 
to look out after their own interests.

I think this is getting a little overheated.  Highway robbers have been a
part of life since the Middle Ages at least.  It's human nature to look
at history through rose colored glasses, but random acts of violence have
been a ceaseless part of our heritage.  Overall, life is better now than it
ever was then.  It's just that random individual acts of violence have
never
been historically significant, and record keeping in the past was never
good
enough to retain them all.

your logic is curious, and spurious.

there is no reason to believe that Viola wouldn't have won as many games

be sure to compare their team's offensive averages too.


now, looking at anything like the Morris-Viola sweepstakes a year later
is basically hindsight. but there were plenty of reasons why it
should have been apparent that Viola was the better pitcher, based
on previous recent years and also based on age (Frank is almost 5
years younger! how many knew that?). people got caught up in the '91
World Series, and then on Morris' 21 wins last year. wins are the stupidest,
most misleading statistic in baseball, far worse than RBI or R. that he
won 21 just means that the Jays got him a lot of runs.

the only really valid retort to Valentine is: weren't the Red Sox trying

He is throwing well, and without pain on the side.

DeShields is not on the DL.  He suffered from the chicken pox and lost

These substitutes exist, and at this time are available. Its the future

1) GHG-12

2) butane/propane  

You can mix this yourself so no one can ever regulate it away.

If this were not true in practice, then certain unethical politicians would
not be passing gun control laws.  Politicians are generally whores to public
opinion.  This does NOT mean the the public is either well informed or correct.
As for the stats,  anyone can support anything with the right stats.  The

Used to own firearms? While armed insurrection, as the FF's of the Const.

Political protest is still an option at this point.  I agree that it's

	As a stong self-defense advocate, you're 'statement', does littel

Based on my experience with a '79 FJ40 ( the hard-top jeep-style model ) I 
would definitely give a new model consideration if I were in the market. The
older models are VERY well built. Unless Toyota lost its mind, I would
assume, until  proven otherwise, that the newer models have inherited some
if not all of the qualities of their ancestors.

Two major differences in the running gear (that I'm aware of) need study.
My '79 has a solid front axle housing whereas the newer models have
independant front suspension. The solid axle is theoretically stronger and
more reliable than the newer model, but only experience will tell. The
independant front suspension is, no doubt, a compromise made to satisfy
the typical user, who will never need a real utility vehicle. The second
difference is the type of transfer case used on the newer models. I'm

I watched the CNN report and I never heard them report that the ATF started the
fire.  They did speculate that the type of CS gas might have _accidentaly_
started the fire.

From my understanding of the CNN report it was 6 HOURS after they started.

              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The track vehicle that I saw in the vicinity of the building where fire was 
first noticed looked more like an armored recovery vehicle (the type used to 
tow tanks of battle fields) and not an armored flame-thrower vehicle.

>napalm, then let the wood stove inside ignite it.
                      ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As someone else has pointed out, why would the stove be in use on a warm day  
in Texas.  It seems to me that it would be very poor planing to hope for a wood
stove to ignite the ""napalm"" when the stove would probably not be in use.  And 
I doubt that it would have taken 6 hours to ignite it.

As I understood it, MSG *is* natural.  Isn't it found in 
tomatoes?

Anyway, lots of people are terribly allergic to lots of natural
things; peanuts, onions, tomatoes, milk, etc.  Just because something
is 'natural' doesn't mean it won't cause problems with some folks.

As for how foods taste:  If I'm not allergic to MSG and I like
the taste of it, why shouldn't I use it?  Saying I shouldn't use
it is like saying I shouldn't eat spicy food because my neighbor
has an ulcer.

People have long modified the taste of food by additives, whether
they be chiles, black pepper, salt, cream sauces, etc.  All of these
things cloud the flavor of the food.  Why do we bother with them?
How should food be tasted?  Isn't it better left to the diner?

      Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to
get a driver's license.  All that is required is one twenty question
quiz and to drive a car around the block without crashing.

>I HAVE to be licensed to drive.  

      In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed
to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.

>My car
>MUST be registered.  

       Most states do not require the registration of cars that are
not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do
so for tax purposes more than anything else.
    
>I MUST (at least where I live) have liability
>insurance on both myself driving and my car (if someone else had an

       Many states do not currently require this, and most, again,
only make this requirement for public roads.  A car sitting unused 
is not required to have insurance.

>Hmm, wouldn't manditory saftey classes, registration
>of both the owner and gun, and manditory liability insurance be nice for
>gun owners.

       The two are not the same, as I pointed out above.  There are
significant difference between making rules for *use on public property*
and *making rules for ownership*.

       The other half of the objection is trust.  Similar things to this
have been tried in many local jurisdications across the country, and
have been abused in far too many cases.   Safety classes which are
never sheduled, never funded, or only one or two is held a year for
a limited number of participants.  Registration lists in New York,
Chicago, and California have been used for confiscation.  *Many* gun
owners would, in theory, support these planes.  (Although the
numbers overwhelmingly show that competence is not the problem, that
intentional misuse is).  They've simply seen it abused and are leery of
the next person who comes down the pike with a ""reasonable"" suggestion
they've already seen abused.

Sorry to put a damper on your plans, but I was there three weeks ago and

Interesting statements, simply because I have been told otherwise.  I'm
certainly not questioning Steve's claims, as for one I am not a doctor, and I
agree that foods don't bring on the recurrence of Crohn's.  But inflammation
can be either mildly or DRASTICALLY enhanced due to food.

Having had one major obstruction resulting in resection (is that a good enough
caveat :-), I was told that a *LOW RESIDUE* diet is called for.  Basically,
the idea is that if there is inflammation of the gut (which may not be
realized by the patient), any residue in the system can be caught in the folds
of inflammation and constantly irritate, thus exacerbating the problem.
Therefore, anything that doesn't digest completely by the point of common
inflammation should be avoided.  With what I've been told is typical Crohn's,
of the terminal ileum, my diet should be low residue, consisting of:

Completely out - never again - items:
	o corn (kernel husk doesn't digest ... most of us know this :-)
	o popcorn (same)
	o dried (dehydrated) fruit and fruit skins
	o nuts (Very tough when it comes to giving up some fudge :-)

Discouraged greatly:
	o raw vegetables (too fibrous)
	o wheat and raw grain breads
	o exotic lettuce (iceberg is ok since it's apparently mostly water)
	o greens (turnip, mustard, kale, etc...)
	o little seeds, like sesame (try getting an Arby's without it!)
	o long grain and wild rice (husky)
	o beans (you'll generate enough gas alone without them!)
	o BASICALLY anything that requires heavy digestive processing

I was told that the more processed the food the better! (rather ironic in this
day and age).  The whole point is PREVENTATIVE ... you want to give your
system as little chance to inflame as possible.  I was told that among the
NUMEROUS things that were heavily discouraged (I only listed a few), to try
the ones I wanted and see how I felt.  If it's bad, don't do it again!
Remember though that this was while I was in remission.  For Veggies: cook the
daylights out of them.  I prefer steaming ... I think it's cooks more
thoroughly - you're mileage may vary.

As with anything else, CHECK WITH YOUR DOCTOR.  Don't just take my word.  But
this is the info I've been given, and it may be a starting point for
discussion.  Good luck!

Thanks for typing that in, Steven.  Sounds like a ""fall back and

These effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new
treatments.  Researchers try to limit this kind of effect by 
performing studies that are ""blind"" in various ways.  Some of these
are:

  o  The subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a 
     placebo or the test treatment, i.e., whether they are in the
     control group or the test group.

  o  Those administering the treatment do not know which subjects 
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

  o  Those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects
     receive a placebo or the test treatment.

Obviously, at the point at which the data is analyzed, one has to 
differentiate the test group from the control group.  But the analysis
is quasi-public: the researcher describes it and presents the data on
which it is based so that others can verify it.  

It is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are
animals, such as mice, there were many cases of skewed results because
those who performed the study did not ""blind"" themselves.  It is not
considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already
are, though it is important that in all respects except the one tested,
the control and test groups are treated alike.

  SPACE CLIPPERS LAUNCHED SUCCESSFULLY
  
  ""On Monday, March 15 at noon, Quest Aerospace Education, Inc.
  launched two DC-Y Space Clippers in the mall near the cafeteria.
  The first rocket was launched by Dr. Bill Gaubatz, director and
  SSTO program manager, and the second by Air Force Captain Ed
  Spalding, who with Staff Sgt. Don Gisburne represents Air Force
  Space Command, which was requested by SDIO to assess the DC-X for
  potential military operational use.  Both rocket launches were
  successful.  The first floated to the ground between the cafeteria
  and Building 11, and the second landed on the roof of the
  cafeteria.
  
  Quest's Space Clipper is the first flying model rocket of the
  McDonnell Douglas DC-X.  The 1/122nd semi-scale model of the
  McDonnell Douglas Delta Clipper has an estimated maximum altitude
  of 300 feet.  The Space Clippers can be used in educational
  settings to teach mathematics and science, as well as social
  studies and other applications.  The Space Clipper is available
  either in the $35 Space Clipper outfit, which includes everything

YES!

I call this notion ""psychological health food"" and, in fact, have
determined that the Four Food Groups are Ice Cream, Pizza, Barbecue, and
Chocolate.  Ideally, every meal should contain something from at least two
of these four groups.  Food DOES serve functions other than nutrition, and
one of them is keeping the organism happy and thus aiding its immune

Yeah, I want to try one of those 42oz steaks (cooked over applewood) at
Wally's Wolf Lodge Inn in Coeur d'Alene.  That seems quite
unrealistic--unrealistically SMALL.  And a few slabs of ribs from the East
Texas Smoker (RIP, again) in Louisville is not at all unrealistic either.  

What say we have a rec.food.cooking dinner at the Moonlite Bar-B-Que Inn in
Owensboro? (It's all you can eat including lamb ribs & mutton for about
$10.)  We could invite Julie Kangas as guest of honor and see if the
Moonlite's Very Hot Sauce is too hot for her.  (It IS too hot for me, and I
don't say that very often.)  And she could bring ice cream with crushed
dried chiltepins for dessert.  

And we could see if there IS such a thing as an ""unrealistically large
quantity"" of barbecue--the owner of the Moonlite estimates that the
Owensboro restaurants serve a hundred thousand pounds of meat a week in the
summer, and forty thousand in the winter--in a town of 50 000 or so.  Two
pounds per person per week?   Again, sure sounds unrealistic to me--thats
just too meager to be healthy.

Thanks for the information!

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri-
helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about
2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU.
If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet
ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter's --
which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could
get under Jupiter's influence.

> Also, perihelions of Gehrels3 were:

> April  1973     83 jupiter radii
> August 1970     ~3 jupiter radii

Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.  So the
1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.
Is that the case for the 1973 figure as well?

    The Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) list for sci.space and sci.astro is
posted approximately monthly. It also covers many questions that come up on
sci.space.shuttle (for shuttle launch dates, see below).

    The FAQ is posted with a long expiration date, so a copy may be in your
news spool directory (look at old articles in sci.space). If not, here are
two ways to get a copy without waiting for the next posting:

    (1) If your machine is on the Internet, it can be obtained by anonymous
FTP from the SPACE archive at ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) in directory
pub/SPACE/FAQ.

    (2) Otherwise, send email to 'archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov'
containing the single line:

help

    The archive server will return directions on how to use it. To get an
index of files in the FAQ directory, send email containing the lines:

send space FAQ/Index
send space FAQ/faq1

    Use these files as a guide to which other files to retrieve to answer
your questions.

    Shuttle launch dates are posted by Ken Hollis periodically in
sci.space.shuttle. A copy of his manifest is now available in the Ames
archive in pub/SPACE/FAQ/manifest and may be requested from the email

Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,
on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.
 If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a
different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,
that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I
would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.

Since I was born in the late Pleistocene, I too remember 1964.  That year,
the Dodgers were several games out of first and I think finished sixth in the
league.  This was kind of odd because they won the World Series both the
previous year and the following year.

An interesting idea consider:   
   At any locality where a buy-back program is being instituted, get a list
of guns they received and compare serial numbers with a list of stolen guns
and sue the people responsible for the program if those guns were destroyed.
Criminal charges can also be made.( Receiving stolen property, destruction of
private property etc.)

The Japanese spacecraft, Hiten, crashed on the Moon last weekend.  For the
past three years it has made several lunar flybys and even did some
aerobraking experiments with Earth's atmosphere.  It was placed in lunar
orbit in February 1992, and I guess it finally ran out of fuel and was
unable to maintain its orbit around the Moon.

Just an comment:  I don't like it when people decide what's good for me...
If you think you're going to decide anything for me, you'd better be 
carrying a badge and a gun.  Who made you capable of determining if there
is ""no way in hell that anybody is going anywhere""?  Why do you find 
it necessary to add to the problem instead of just minding your own 
business?  If someone is minding their own business, I will give them
all the room they want, and I'll try to make things easy for them, even
letting them in in front of me if they ask politely (with a directional).
On the other hand, if someone like you decides they want to block me and
be a general asshole, you can bet your ass that I'll make life as 
miserable as possible for you, as long as it doesn't affect anyone else
who's minding their own business.  
They have a phrase to describe someone like you:
Self Appointed Traffic Police.
Just mind your own business and stay in the right lane where you belong.

I recall reading in the recently revised edition of the ""Yeast Connection""
that there is indeed work by researchers to do this.  Of course, they are
working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus
membrane tissue with associated ""mild"" inflammatory response can and does
occur in a large number of people.  If you reject this ""yeast hypothesis"",
then I'd guess you'd view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic
endeavor.  Stay tuned.

Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not
_The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't
remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola,
travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when
one of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction
of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven.
But the notion is not pursued further than that.

I hope Gordon Banks did not mean to imply that notions such as
hard-to-see candida infections causing various problems should not
be investigated.  Many researchers have made breakthroughs by 
figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought
""virtually impossible to test for.""

Indeed, I would be surprised if ""candida overbloom"" were such a
phenomena.  I would think that candida would produce signature
byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the 
extent of recent infection.  I realize this might get quite 
tricky and difficult, probably expensive, and likely inconvenient
or uncomfortable to the subjects, but that is not the same as 
""virtually impossible.""

Subject: DC-Y trajectory simulation
Keywords: SSTO, Delta Clipper
Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana
Lines: 91


I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a
single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3
scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is 
currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale 
experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.

On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled 
""Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions"" here at the University of
Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and
determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is
not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with 
them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used 
the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details
of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope
they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will
be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.

The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The
main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that
this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I
did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters
and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in 
mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson
showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:
                  ______
3 G         /|   /      |
           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly 
          /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines
2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are
        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as
       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.

                        |

             ^          ^
           ~100 sec    ~400 sec


As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below
3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the
accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are 
throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it
soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in 
accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines
bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut
out entirely.

The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed
for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of
air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to 
that desired.

Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)

Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than
    all at once?

A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.

Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?

A:  Can't tell us.  ""Read Aviation Leak.""  He also apparently had a good 
    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  

My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting
national security or MD protecting their own interests?

The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch
up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and 
the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs
of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,
and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.
The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have
about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 
60 degrees south latitude.

I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that
aspect of the flight profile.

This is fascinating.  You say that Alomar was the better hitter last

had a better year.  The only category that I see which shows an advantage
for Alomar is OBP.

Chemical weapons are not concidered a *very* effectiv weapon against
millitary forces. On civillians on the other hand....

That's one GOOD reason for banning it.

You need VAST amounts of chemicals to be affective, so the best reason
to have/use it is price. (that's why it's called The Poor Mans A-bomb)

Any thoughts on Bio-weapons ??	

If this discusion is about civillians having chem-weapons;
What should they use them on?? Rob a bank ??

Maybe I can help you. He's a major league coach with the Rockies.
So above prediction is doubly wrong.

My prediction: The Red Sox-Cubs Series and Vikings-Broncos SuperBore will
occur at the end of the world.

And one Rockie will finish in the top 10 of an offensive catagory this 
year.

And no Rockie starter will have an ERA below 3.50.

And the Rangers fade will not begin until...August. They'll give way
to the Angels. But still challenge to the end.

Really. Not making any of this up. If I am, may God strike me down *ZZZZZZT*

rec.autos,"Subject: After-Market Cruise Controls: Specific Questions
From: MikeW@Canc.byu.edu (M.D. (Mike) Wieda)
Organization: BYU
Nntp-Posting-Host: 128.187.203.40
Lines: 82

Howdy,

I'm a little new to this newsgroup, but I would like to tap some of the
knowledge and expertise available here.

The Subject:  After-market cruise controls

The Background:
I recently broke my ankle in a road-bicycling accident (4 places, five 
screws, yuk! :-( ).  In two weeks I will be returning to Texas (my
home) from my school (BYU) in Provo, Utah.  As you can imagine, trying to
drive nearly 1300 miles with a broken right ankle isn't just the epitome of
a good time.  My car does not have a cruise control, so I would have to do
all the pedalling (ha ha) with my messed-up ankle.

My question:
What is the general opinion of after-market cruise control units?  I
realize that a cheap CC (cruise control) from, say, Pep Boys, isn't going to
be as good as a factory or professionally installed unit (if there is such a
thing).  And I uderstand that I probably can't expect much in the way of
accuracy, looks and that sort of thing;  But anything's gotta be better than
trying to drive with a hosed ankle.

I have a 1984 Jeep Cherokee, 4 speed, standard, 4*4, 2.5L engine with
kettering(sp?) ignition (y'know, distributor cap, rotor, that set-up--not
electronic.  Maybe you could've guessed it being an '84, but I'm just trying
to give information as completly as I can).

I found a CC unit for 80 bucks.  It seems to use the vehicles vacuum system 
instead of an electric servor/motor.  Is this good or bad?  If I did buy
this CC, which vacuum hose should I tap?

It has two speed sensors:  One magnetic, and one that gets a signal from the 
negative side of the distributor, kinda like a tach pick-up, or so I
understand.  I can use either one.  Which is best?  The manual says (I read
it in the store today) that the magnetic/axle set-up is more accurate, but
harder to install.  Is there really a big difference?

It has a sensor for the brake pedal, just like other CCs, but does NOT have a
sensor for the clutch pedal.  So if I wasn't paying real close attention I
might push the clutch in while the cruise is trying to get the speed up.  Which
would wind the engine up kinda high until I got my wits about me and turned 
the thing off.  I'm pretty coordinated, so this doesn't bother me, if it
were for my girlfriends car, *then* it would bother me, but I'm ok with it.

The installation also calls for an attachment to a steady-on brake signal
and a switched-on brake signal.  I think I can get a switched brake signal
from the correct side of the brake light blade fuse.  Am I right?  But I'm
not sure where to get the steady-on brake signal, or, for that matter, what
exactly it is?  Any ideas as to what the manufaturer wants and where to get
it?

I think I can figure the other things out.  Like how to hook-up the negative
side tach-type sensing gizmo and the cabin control unit, and the ground and
all that miscellaneous business.  But I need a little help with:

	1.  Is it worth the money and safety risk (if any) for such a
	    device?
	2.  Is there any particularly good after-market CC?
	3.  Are ""professionally"" installed CCs signifacantly better and
	    worth the cabbage?
	4.  If the unit I saw (sorry, no manufacturer or model number, just
	    that it is at Pep Boy and its $80) is sufficient for my simple 
	    needs, how do I get the thing installed properly (specifically,
	    the questions above)?

My father and I built a ""Veep"" (Volkswagen powered Jeep CJ-2A) when I was in
high school, so I consider myself fairly good with tools, electronics, and
cars.  So the installation doesn't scare me.  I just want to be certain that
I get the thing installed correctly as my Cherokee is just a wee bit more
complicated than my Veep. :-)

I appreciate your time in reading my post, and I would appreciate any
expertise or opinion anybody has on the subject.  If you would like to share
some of your wisdom, please email as I don't get over this group very often
(but I check my mail all the time).

Again, thanks for any help anyone may have.

All Toyotas have airbags with a real horn. Come on, how hard can it
be to put a little pressure plate there. I hope Toyota doesn't follow
everyone else and make the horns little buttons that I wouldn't want

    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS

    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on
    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.

		     (1/3.4)
    D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km
	 g  p  f  n

	       (1/6)
    S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than
     g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface
					    e		      t
			      gravity of the target body. This scaling is
			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for
			      other bodies.

		(1/3.4)
    S = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  ,
     p	  a   t							    t
			      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U
			       a
			      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average
			      rock on the continental shields.

    C			    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km
			      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).

							    (1/3.4)
    K			    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)
     n			      empirically determined from the Jangle U
			      nuclear test crater.

	      3		   2		       19
    W = pi * d	* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )
			    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent
			      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile
			      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3
			      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.

    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing
    asteroids.

    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor
    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in
    diameter.

    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):

    Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy
    diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* 5*10^20 ergs)

     10			    10		     10^-8		10^9
      1			 1 000		     10^-6		10^6
      0.1	       100 000		     10^-4		10^3

    assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT
    equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.

    MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY

    Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the ""Encyclopaedia
    Brittanica"", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing
    in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, 1990). The latter was written with
    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind
    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).

    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John
    Snyder's USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS
    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32
    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both
    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a
    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.

    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,
    ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This
    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are
    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.

    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:
    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National
    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and
    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.

    A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,
    (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call
    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a
    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up
    for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.

    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:

	R. Miller and F. Reddy, ""Mapping the World in Pascal"",
	Byte V12 #14, December 1987

	Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A
	demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data
	is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.

    Some references for spherical trignometry are:

    THREE-DIMENSIONAL STAR/GALAXY COORDINATES

    To generate 3D coordinates of astronomical objects, first obtain an
    astronomical database which specifies right ascension, declination, and
    parallax for the objects. Convert parallax into distance using the
    formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates
    on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and
    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and
    scale this by the distance.

    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog
    (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or ""The Catalogue of Stars within 25
    parsecs of the Sun"" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on
    ames.arc.nasa.gov).

FOR DISCUSSION PURPOSES ONLY

On the other hand, if it can be proven, it's possible the changed 
terms could be thrown out.  The question will be whether the 
agreement contains a merger clause.  See UCC @ 2-202 (parol 
evidence).  If we're talking about warranties, then, of course, 
UCC @ 2-316 should be looked at.

But we have so little information that none of us can say anything 
conclusive.

Sony D-88 portable Diskman
========================== This is the one designed to play the mini CD's.
You can play normal size CDs, but the disk sticks out the side.  Works
well,
but may skip occasionally - it should be tuned up (heads aligned, cleaned,
etc.)  In excellent condition.  It has not been used all that much.  With
carrying case.  Original list was (I think) $300, but I'll take $80 or best
offer.  It would be good for an office or just to sit on your desk.

Yes, long before Star Trek.  Before Einstein, in fact.

Vulcan as a planet inside Mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation
of Mercury's orbit that could not be explained by the known planets.  But
Einstein's theory of relativity explained Mercury's motion, and analysis
of Mercury's motion now shows there are _not_ any planets inside its orbit.

Probably within 50 years, a new type of eugenics will be possible.
Maybe even sooner.  We are now mapping the human genome.  We will
then start to work on manipulation of that genome.  Using genetic
engineering, we will be able to insert whatever genes we want.
No breeding, no ""hybrids"", etc.  The ethical question is, should

You're assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface
into sunlight.  Not so.  Even on Earth, each pole gets several weeks without
sunlight in mid-winter.  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial
tilt and a much longer orbit.  Pluto's north pole, for example, gets over
a century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light.

At the moment, we're in luck -- Pluto and Charon are just past their
equinox, when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles (of each).
If we get probes there soon, only the immediate vicinity of one pole
(on each) will be in long-term shadow.  This will get steadily worse the
longer we wait.

You don't say whether or not you have any symptoms other than pain.
If you have numbness, weakness or bladder problems, for example,
these would suggest a need for surgery. If pain is your only symptom
you might do well to find a reputable, multi-disciplinary pain
clinic in your area. Chronic low back pain generally doesn't do well
with surgery, acute on chronic pain (as only symptom) doesn't fare
much better.
e correlation between MRI findings and symptoms is controversial.

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Contact:  OASIS (310) 364-2290

   15 April 1993                                Los Angeles, CA

     LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY L.A.
  ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD

   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National 
Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-
inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.
Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science
Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.

   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space
Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell
International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or
coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David
Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.

   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal
experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build
the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a
potential to power the globe.

   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half
from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.

   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous
source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever
increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space
Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the
National Space Society, which is an international non-profit

Subject: WI and IL firearms law Questions
Organization: University of Wisconsin, Milwaukee
Lines: 39
NNTP-Posting-Host: 129.89.9.13



A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:  

Question #1

According to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is
'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a 
""concealed and dangerous weapon.""  There is no statutory provision for
obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.'

*  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm
on one's person or within his immediate control and available for use.



Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it
have to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What
if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,
is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,
period? 

Question #2

As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.
Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if
you were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting
in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending 
trial for the shooting?
Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled
shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, 
either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  
One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being
rich or famous or related to the mayor?

Please send replies via E-Mail, as things seem to be piling up around t.p.g
a little faster than I can handle.  Thanks again

Organization: Skidmore College, Saratoga Springs NY

One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't
yet been addressed.  I believe the rule also does *not* deal with this
situation:

If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up
and advance at their own risk, as on any fly ball.

However, if the Infield Fly is *not* caught, at what point can a
runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for
advancing too early?  When the
ball hits the ground?  When a fielder first touches the ball after it
hits the ground?

Enlightenment would be appreciated.

Subject: RIMSAT, US/Russian joint venture
Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana
Lines: 121


I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an
informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.
ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and
International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the
company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that
his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.

The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga
to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,
who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which 
the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,
His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought
there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous
satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,
seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of
slots.

The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl
Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions
supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 
70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).
According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the
world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and 
the Pacific Rim. 

RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax
haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to
fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have
cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.
Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began 
negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in 
Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.
Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way
that people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything.""  
Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the
only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.

Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost
of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg
says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who 
went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was
out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He
again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,
he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the 
Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions
before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to 
allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.

The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied 
Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in 
Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built
about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that
siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest
people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this
point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on
both siberians and midwesterners :-)

Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is 
apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that
would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them 
specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites
that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This
compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1
million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their 
satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They 
have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give
you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are
getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place
now.

Tidbits:

*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big
business because big business is just like what they have over there, except
that ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""

*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch
within 9 months.

*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement
fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,
and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is
sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.

*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried
partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying
monolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we don't worry 
because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what
really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.

*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering
money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting
25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in 
rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian
bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that
the only the contractors get swindled by the government.

*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western 
satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type
of satellites, which was rather reassuring.

*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive
technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have
a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare
well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much 
shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the 
difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,
shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer
technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date
hardware.

Rumor has it that a guy at Dell Computer had his Miata totalled, so that would

The current mining regulations and fees were set in the 1800's!
What the so-called ""eco-freaks"" want to do is to simply bring those
fees in line with current economic reality.  Currently, mining companies
can get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices --
something like $50!  The mining lobby has for decades managed to block
any reform of these outdated fees.  In fact, the latest attempt to reform
them was again blocked -- President Clinton ""compromised"" by taking the
mining fee reforms out of his '94 budget, and plans to draft separate
legislation to fight that battle.
If you want to discuss this further, I suggest you take this to talk.environment.

Dear Netters:

I am looking to buy a used Eagle Talon '91 or '91 TSi AWD.
Question is that the '91 TSi AWD was mentioned in the
April Consumer Reports to a car to avoid!

In particular, the manual transmission, electrical system,
and brakes were below par (in both models).  A friend of mine
ownes a '90 TSi AWD and he has had 2 brake jobs (pads), one
stuck valve, and some clutch/transmission problem, something
about sticking/grinding into second gear.  This doesn't seem
too bad if one ""beats"" on his car.

I am willing to suffer reliability--for speed and looks.  Seems
you have to pay big buck if you want all three.  Anyway can
anyone please let me know how you like your Talon, and any
problems you may have had, and if the repairs are worth it.

Thanks for any responses!

    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO

    INTRODUCTION

    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet
groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to
frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth
preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked
questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to
leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).

    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to
your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader
that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).

    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down
by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in
the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.

    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The
point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old
answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing
than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided
because they give more complete information than any short generalization.

    Questions fall into three basic types:

    1) Where do I find some information about space?

    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask
    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There
    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended
    discussion.

    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?

    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been
    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for
    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.

    3) Miscellanous queries.

    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of
    FAQ postings.


    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE

    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.
    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]
    Edit ""Subject:"" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.
    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth
	100 posts).
    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST
	not SPACE.
    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all
	references.)
    Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're
	responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize!
    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail
	or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the
	'reply' function of mailers will work.
    Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone
	will get on TV anyway.
    Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping:
	keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals
	(use carriage returns).

FYI...I just posted this on alt.psychoactives as a response to
what the group is for......


A note to the users of alt.psychoactives....

This group was originally a takeoff from sci.med.  The reason for
the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive
drugs....such as antidepressents(tri-cyclics, Prozac, Lithium,etc),
antipsychotics(Melleral(sp?), etc), OCD drugs(Anafranil, etc), and
so on and so forth.  It didn't take long for this group to degenerate
into a psudo alt.drugs atmosphere.  That's to bad, for most of the
serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have
left and gone back to sci.med, where you have to cypher through
hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data.

It was also to discuss real-life experiences and side effects of
the above mentioned.

Oh well, I had unsubscribed to this group for some time, and I decided
to check it today to see if anything had changed....nope....same old
nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for.

I think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it
being moderated...too bad.

Oh well, obviously, no one really cares.

Bill Claussen


Would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group?

If amnesty was their concern, they should pay in cash rather than moneyorder
and they should check to see if the gun turned in was stolen or not.
This way if a gun turns out to be stolen, then even if they wanted to 
prosecute, they don't know who to prosecute.
Since the only concern of these(HCI and the like) people seems to be the total
eradication of guns( legal or illegal ), why should they bother to check for
stolen property.  If they knew who the rightful owner is, then they would have
to return the gun and hence contrary to their intent to ban all guns.

Yeah, if the Tigers can keep scoring 20 runs a game.  If I'm reading all this  
woofing correctly, one midseason slump is going to pull this team out of

  Trust me, you'd have a helluva time manipulating them. Besides, if you
converted the film to video you'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the
difference in frame rate (unless you're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for
a laserdisc company or something).

  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at 
the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could
hit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes
contact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he
caught not ready for a pitch. 

  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
practice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-) 

  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front
foot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but
I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
out of his hips. 

>Gary's list of ""I'd give Dave Kirsch's kidneys to have a swing like that.""

  Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but .. 

  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others. I really like Dean
Palmer's swing, for some twisted reason, as well as Pedro Munoz's swing. 

>That's all for now.  I'm looking at Derrick May's tapes tonight, along

  A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball.
IMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
off the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders
low and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left 
and left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to 
the right side of the infield in the next month.

	Harumph. Getting published in these newsletters is hardly something
to aspire to. :-)
	I can't really argue with your logic, though I think you may be
extrapolating a bit recklessly from what appears to be a sample size of
one. Even if what you say about this local Pittsburgh guy is true, it is
not logical or fair to conclude that this is true of all doctors who
treat Lyme disease.
	By your logic, I could conclude that all of the physicians who
consult for insurance companies and make money by denying benefits to
Lyme patients are doing it for the money, rather than because they believe
they are encouraging good medicine. I have no idea how sincere these guys
are, but their motives are as suspect as the physicians you excoriate for
what you believe to be indiscriminate treatment.
	I would really feel more comfortable discussing the medical issues
in Lyme, rather than speculating as to the motives of the various parties
involved.

   I was recently thumbing through the 1993 Lemon-Aid New

under the picture while a few sentences later noting how a
driver and passenger were virtually guaranteed to be killed
in a front end collision.  The most highly recommended small
car (The Civic) has the worst crash rating of all of the small
cars listed.  There were many such cases of 'great' vehicles
where you wouldn't survive an accident.  Is it only me, or is
safety not one of the most important factors when buying a car?

Unfortunately, Hep B infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and
subsequent cirrhosis.  Although not many patients with Hep B go on to
chronic hepatitis, it does still occur in a good number (20%?) and is
something to keep in mind.  Hepatitis C (was: non-A, non-B Hep) much
more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis.  There is also an
autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which
also leads to cirrhosis.  

Of course, cirrhosis is a most unkind disease.  The most dangerous
effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function. 
Patients develop life-threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas,
among many other problems, as a result of disturbances in hepatic
circulation.  Less ominously, they can exhibit the effects of
hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis. 
These effects include telangiactasias (small red skin lesions) and, in
men, gynecomastia (breast development).  The only real treatment for
cirrhosis is liver transplant.

Keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected, at least statistically, in
your friend's case.  Nevertheless you might want to bring up the
subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor.  Hopefully he
or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of Hep B infection to
you, and offer you support.

If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first.
I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain
everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then
on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug
and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably
didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit
they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or
something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they
report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating
that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough
liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to
happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information
on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the
AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.
There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.
Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks
to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to ""go ballistic"",
but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been
reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume
it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will
refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for
PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with
tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.
I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the
domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions
about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.
For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help
quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the
computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,
physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,
as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked
things that the patients should have found out from their physician
but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.
Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to
ask the system, we hope.

I was worried about someone stealing my oil once also. I finally 
decided to just have my drain plug welded shut. It works great !
I figure that when I add three or four quarts when the oil light
comes on every month or so that it's just as good or better than
the old wives tale of changing the oil AND filter every 3000 miles.
Works for me, I must say.

I don't think so at first,  but solid state offered  better reliabity,

The tater that Jack Morris served to Griffey the Younger in his first

The quality of autobahns is something of a myth. The road surface
isn't much different to a typical TX freeway. They are better
in terms of lighting, safety, signs, roadmarkings etc. I'd have
no problem driving 130 on most US freeways, as it is, I save it
for the backroads, which really are more likely to be dangerous.

>than most of the roads here. A dip in the asphalt that you test your

It would have to be quite severe. I don't recall any US freeway,
without road damage warnings, that i would regard as unsafe
at 130 in any decent, well damped car. Note that my definition
of decent, well damped, would exclude most typical American sedans.

I don't know where you live, but I would be much more worried
about cops, other traffic etc. than the road surface at 130.
It just isn't that fast or that dangerous. If you have a Probe
GT, no problem. The 4cyl models I have driven would be
likely to be unpredictable at higher speeds.

Digression 6.1:  Miracle Berries and the Modification of Taste Receptors

Although the _miracle berry_, a plant native to West Africa is practically
tasteless, it temporarily changes the taste of other substances.  Miracle
berries contain a protein, _miraculin_, that modifies sweet receptors in
such a way that they can be stimulated by acids (Bartoshuk, Gentile, 
Moskowitz, & Meiselman, 1974).  If you ever get a chance to chew a miracle
berry (and I do recommend it), for about the next half an hour all acids 
(which are normally sour) will taste sweet.  They will continue to taste
sour as well.

Miraculin was, for a time, commercially available in the United States as a
diet aid.  The idea was that dieters could coat their tongue with a miraculin
pill and then eat and drink unsweetened, slightly acidic substances.  Such
substances would taste sweet without providing many calories.

A colleague and I once spent an evening experimenting with miracle berries.
We drank straight lemon juice, sauerkraut juice, even vinegar.  All tasted
extremely sweet.  Somehow we forgot how acidic these substances are.  We 
awoke the next day to find our mouths full of ulcers.

[... continued discussion of a couple other taste-altering substances ...]

Please, PAY ATTENTION.
I, and others, were referring to TOTAL HOMICIDE DEATHS, NOT JUST
HANDGUN HOMICIDES.  In terms of how likely are you to be killed,
(regardless of how it's done, 'cause DEAD is DEAD), the UK has a
higher homicide rate. Period.  You are more likely to be killed in the
UK than in Switzerland.  If you were to be murdered with a handgun,
then yes, Switzerland has a higher rate.  But, to belabor the point,
you are MORE LIKELY to be murdered in the UK. In that sense, the
weapon is irrelevant.  The UK is more violent, period.

	SeAL Team six should have handled it?  Delta Force?  The
BATF had more than enough equipment and men.  They did not have

in just the most basic military sense, they fucked up.  Excuses do

	And your excuses fall upon deaf ears when the same BATF
has shown shitty leadership despite more people, better weapons,
and exclusive use of armor against their targets.  BATF is nothing
more than a private army of the government.  Do the agents swear an
oath, as I did, to uphold the Constitution?  You know, that document
that stipulates the highest law of the land?  If they do, they should
be up for charges in a court of law.  Remember, the law?  That's
the whole reason for any of this.

your body?  Think of it as the price you have to pay that we may all
live without fear of my making a stray shot.  It's fine and dandy to
revel in the other guy being the target and your supposed safety.  In
the military, we called this ""chicken shit.""  Leadership from the rear.
The War on Drugs, despite being a catchy term for nothing more than
a continuation of policy since before this century, seems to have
gotten you convinced that my rights aren't worth your good vibes.
Mind if I cut your net access, as well as access to any and all forms
of expression?  See, you make me nervous, what with you being able
to influence so many.  I'm sure you can see how this is the price we
have to pay for freedom and liberty in this country, as well as

	Mind if we include you in the body count?  I'm sure we could
all file it under ""civic improvement"" and your life wouldn't have
been sacrificed in vain.  If you like, you can will your estate to
defecit reduction, too.  Now, when you learn how the law protects, or

one day be on your collective throat, perhaps at that time you will
mature enough to realize just what you're talking about and how

Fellow netters,

I have an Okidata printer I would like to sell.  A description follows:

Okidata 180 printer including cables for both IBM compatibles (Centronics
parallel) and Commodore (RS-232 - round).  Also includes power cable, manual,
and a handful of computer paper to get you started.  This is a 9-pin printer. 
I recently cleaned the printhead and installed a new ribbon.  A print sample 
can be provided upon request.  This is a very dependable printer - it never
jams or does ""weird"" things.  I have used it with a Commodore for about 3 years
and am now using it with my 486sx.  I use mainly WordPerfect 5.1 (see next
post) for which I got a driver (at no charge) that directly supports the 
Okidata 180 in Epson FX mode. 

When I got the printer, it was selling for around $200-220 new (I got mine
from Tenex brand new - for a Christmas present).  I would like to get about
$100 or so for it.  If you are interested at all in it, please give me a ring

  Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by
  mid-season. C'mon, the Phillies haven't proved anything yet. Atlanta
  was similar to the Phils 2 years ago. They sucked. They started having
  a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the
  division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST   
  have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect
  either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good
  the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils
  record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will
  improve dramatically.  
  No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team.

  This strikes me as a tad ingenous.  ""If X had done/note done Y, then Z would
never have happened.""  I tend to place tha responsibility on the group/person
actually committing the act, not on those whon ""forced them to do it"".

  After all, to take an extreme example, if the British were not in Northern
Ireland, the IRA would not be forced to place bombs in shopping centers.

  That said, this whole sorry story was a totally unecessary, utterly fucked
up mess from the get go.

How can you say that?  I presume that you mean that talking about
restricting rights is not the same as restricting those rights.  Well,
arguing for those restrictions may lead to implementation, much
the same way as assault can lead to battery (legal definitions).

Well, I can't speak for the homosexuals, but I've seen ALOT
of polite discussion on t.p.g.  Please, everyone, don't take
this guy's word, or mine for that matter, on it.  Read t.p.g.
for a while, and try to determine from which direction most of
the flameage originates.  If you post without flamebait, you
will generally receive reasoned responses.  True, there are
those who tend to lose their tempers quickly, as there are on
all newsgroups, but they really do feel their rights are in jeopardy.

Oh, and neat trick talking derisively about another newsgroup while
not crossposting to allow them to defend themselves.

Thanks to all those who responded to my original post on this question.  The
final diagnosis was Stress.  I did not take her for a chiropractic adjustment.
(Rachel receives all her medical care at Keller Army Hospital since she is a
military dependant, and the Army does not yet provide chiropractic adjustments
as part of its regular health care.)  I am hoping that the arrival of (1)
Spring Break, and (2) College Acceptance Letters, will help.  *UNFORTUNATELY*
she was wait-listed at the college she most dearly wanted to attend, so it
seems as though that stressor may just continue for a while.  :-(

Meanwhile she is going on a camping trip with her religious youth group for
spring break, which seems like a good stress-reliever to me.

Thanks again for everybody's help/advice/suggestions/ideas.

The Japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes.
This means that unlike the Germans (who do great things all by themselves)
the Japanese tie up with foreign companies. The major one is Mitsubishi
(who else) who have a sharing agreement with GE I think. No chance of a

Sodium has *lots* of chemical problems. Like it eats stainless steel. Very
slowly but it gets there in the end. Not what I call a desired property.
As for design difficulties, what does sodium do there? It is a bitch and
it is only its chemical properties (flwed though they are) that means it
gets used. Two loops? That's not a design problem? Isolation from air and
water? That doesn't cause design problems? In comparison BWR's a dream rides!

Don't get none of that in a Liquid Sodium Breeder! More steel, more complexity.

 Dennis Deconcini, 1982
 
...In these and similar areas, the
Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5
U.S.C. Sec 552, which was intended to prevent ""secret lawmaking"" by
administrative bodies.
   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-
committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded
rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United
States.
   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise
of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.
   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-
ing and seizing private property.
   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property
without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-
out regard for their right to due process of law.
   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was
utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the
Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities
were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-
gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to
be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently
made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-
tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before
BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence
was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF
gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither
criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into
unknowning technical violations.

                        WASHINGTON : 1982
 
 
Letter to Constituent: April 1993
 
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with
jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.
 
It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations
Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which
funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly
professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.
The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in
successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use
of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It
enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory
minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an
illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in
preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk
youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known
gangs from access to weapons.
 
The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF
on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession
(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs
and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to
trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where
they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF
is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with
state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state
and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office
felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally
establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and
thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members
of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a
Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would
be separated from the women and children and not in the area where
it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.
 
As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh
spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending
execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the
element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and
prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation
presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the
FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military
tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and
firepower of the Branch Davidians.
 
Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian
raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply
saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who
attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the
cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a
thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside
the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for
Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the
Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the
evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick
and peaceful conclusion.
 
Sincerely,
 
Dennis DeConcini
Chairman
Subcommittee on Treasury,
Postal Service and
General Government

Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial.
After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided
that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant
posting.

*** file follows *** 

Hi Folks;

As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it
kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the
Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.

Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other
legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things
start today.

More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen
Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the
courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, ""Who stands
trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)
Weaver?""  On the evening news she said, ""I am here protesting
because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
I thought we all did.""  Nice sound bite (grin)!

The news reporter also interviewed some guy named ""Tim""
who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the
guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he
expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.
""Tim"" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver
and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop
telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know
the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law
against political activity within X feet of a courthouse
or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).

Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed
an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam
FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.

Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to
leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case
any.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence
came out, that Weaver would be aquitted.

More stuff as it comes available.

Gee, you really make me confused.  What is radiator?  Where is it located?

Also would maybe get the Russians Involved. After all they do have the resources
to do it in part.. But they need the capital and the goal..

I wonder if renting the russians resources would be a disqualification?

The graphics capabilities of the computers were very faked for movie 
audiences who have not ability or patience with numbers.  The book was more 
realistic in that respect.  In all respects, actually.  The robotics are 
still out of range, but not impossible.

SF (and I""ve always wondered how Crichton escapes this classification) is 
usually ahead of science in both prediction and precaution.  NASA's 
decontaimination processes were supposedly taken to prevent SF story 
disasters.  I mean, NASA scientists were often SF readers (and 
sometimes writers) and felt pre-warned by their reading.

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin.
50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.
That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year,
but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.

I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's
nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP
to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release
is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming
I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.

If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar
could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff
Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.

UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES

    Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below
    would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design
    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.


    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into
    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20
    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas
    scintillation proportional counters.


    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint
    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian
    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini
    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.
    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA
    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon
    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens
    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours
    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter
    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan
    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and
    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the
    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,
    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's
    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.

    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its
    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These
    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.

    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the
    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of
    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan
    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan
    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true
    nature of Saturn's rings.

    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned
    the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to
    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have
    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data
    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from
    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve
    approximately 70% of its original objectives.

    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. Has made
    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,
    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon.


    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire
    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity
    map.


    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.
    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in
    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for
    one martian year (687 days).


    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched
    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the
    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global
    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially
    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also
    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.


    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over
    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields
    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for
    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.

    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of
    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from
    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist
    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole
    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its
    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft
    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!

    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and
    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see
    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical
    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.


    OTHER SPACE SCIENCE MISSIONS (note: this is based on a posting by Ron
    Baalke in 11/89, with ISAS/NASDA information contributed by Yoshiro
    Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp). I'm attempting to track changes based
    on updated shuttle manifests; corrections and updates are welcome.

    1993 Missions
	o ALEXIS [spring, Pegasus]
	    ALEXIS (Array of Low-Energy X-ray Imaging Sensors) is to perform
	    a wide-field sky survey in the ""soft"" (low-energy) X-ray
	    spectrum. It will scan the entire sky every six months to search
	    for variations in soft-X-ray emission from sources such as white
	    dwarfs, cataclysmic variable stars and flare stars. It will also
	    search nearby space for such exotic objects as isolated neutron
	    stars and gamma-ray bursters. ALEXIS is a project of Los Alamos
	    National Laboratory and is primarily a technology development
	    mission that uses astrophysical sources to demonstrate the
	    technology. Contact project investigator Jeffrey J Bloch
	    (jjb@beta.lanl.gov) for more information.

	o Wind [Aug, Delta II rocket]
	    Satellite to measure solar wind input to magnetosphere.

Politicians want to eliminate private ownership of guns before the

to fund the federal government as an ever higher percentage of tax
revenue goes to pay interest on the national debt (currently 57 cents

>spouse, a friend, or child than to kill an intruder.  

       The ""used to kill"" is the heart of the misinformation.  It's one
of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.
What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people
read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family
grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation
which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or
a tragic accident, especially involving a child.

       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority
of that 43 ""times"" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone 
intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill 
themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,
the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as
comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural
factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.
(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There
people jump off buildings.)

       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime
is commited by ""non-strangers,"" which mistakenly has been generalized
regarding the King County study to mean, ""Friends and family.""  That
is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on
the mental image that a ""Friend, family member, or child,"" equates
to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of
anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,
children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by 
someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun
was used against a ""friend"" or family member doesn't mean they
weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among
poor urban families, and those are also the areas most ""at risk""
for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may
not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban
kid might.

       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the
only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I
worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly
self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.
Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous
amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.
As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid
means of determining the success of such a defense, since according
to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report
defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders
killed.

       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a ""friend
or family member"" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense
which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in
businesses.)

>Studies by the 
>Western Psychiatric Institute, in Pittsburgh, found that the mere presence
>of a gun in the home sharply incresases the likelihood a family member
>will commit suicide, even in the absence of psychiatric illness.""

       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I
will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that
culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.

       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what
it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural
lines) published in the New England Journal of Medicine (I can get the
exact cite if you need it) that concluded that restrictive firearm laws 
would not significantly impact the over-all suicide rate.

I've had my Subaru Liberty 4WD station wagon for about 8 months now. Saying
I'm happy with it would be an understatement!

Just great. Well built, handles beautifully, plenty of power. I've only
had if 'off tar' once. Did a trip over the mountains on a narrow, windy
dirt road, often _very dodgey_ in parts. The Subaru did it with ease.
I havent had so much fun driving a car for years!

Any other owners out there?

This is in fact a hot topic in medicine these days, and much of the
medical literature is devoted to this.  The most heavily funded studies
these days are for outcome research, and physicians (and others!) are
constantly questionning whether what we do it truly effective in any given
situation.  QA activities are a routine part of every hospital's
administrative function and are required by accreditation agencies.  There
are even entire publications devoted to QA issues.

I'd dump him.  Rude is rude and it seems he enjoys belittling and
humiliating you.  But don't just dump him, write to him and tell
him why you are firing him.  If you can, think about sending a copy
of your letter to whoever is in charge of the clinic where he works, 
if applicable, or maybe even to the AMA.  Don't be vindictive in
your letter, be truthful but VERY firm.

But don't be a victim and just put up with it.  Take control!  It'll

Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to
release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  Yes, I know
he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than
Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question.  If Slaught was so obviously
better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he
have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties?

This reminds me of the last Graham Kerr cooking show I saw.  Today he
smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot!  He used a strange technique
I'd never seen before.

He took a big pot with lid, and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil.
The tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee-table ash tray,
made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges.

In the tray, he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar, a similar
quantity of brown rice (he said any rice will do), the contents of two
teabags of Earl Grey tea, and a few cloves.

On top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket-type steamer, with
two chicken breasts in it.  The lid was put on, and the whole assembly
went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes.

Later, he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts.  What surprises
and concerns me are:

1)  No wood chips.  Where does the smoke flavor come from?

2)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember hearing that carmel color
    (obtained by caramelizing sugar -- a common coloring and flavoring
    agent) had been found to be carcinogenic.  I believe they injected
    it under the skin of rats, or something.  If the results were conclusive,
    caramel color would not be legal in the U.S., yet it is still being
    used.  Was the initial research result found to be incorrect, or what?

3)  About 5 or 10 years ago, I remember Earl Grey tea being implicated
    as carcinogenic, because it contains oil of bergamot (an extract
    from the skin of a type of citrus fruit).  Does anyone know whatever
    happened with that story?  If it were carcinogenic, Earl Grey tea
    could not have it as an additive, yet it apparently continues to do
    so.

WRT natural wood smoke (I've smoking a duck right now, as it happens),
I've noticed that a heavily-smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy
taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently
stopped flowing.  I find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips,
getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process,
then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips.

My theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low-molecular weight
stuff, like terpenes, and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort
of larger molecule more similar to tar.  The long barbeque time after
the initial intensive smoke drives off the low-molecular weight stuff,
just leaving the flavor behind.  Does anyone know if my theory is correct?

I also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping
on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic.  For that reason, and because
it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess, I only grill
non-drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals.  I do stuff like this
duck by indirect heat.  I have a long rectangular Weber, and I put the coals
at one end and the meat at the other end.  The fat drops directly on the
floor below the meat, and next time I use the barbeque I make the fire
in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals.

And yet another reason I've heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that
smoked cured meat, like pork sausage and bacon, contains
nitrosamines, which are carcinogenic.  I'm pretty sure this claim actually
has some standing, don't know about the others.

An amusing incident I recall was the Duncan Hines scandal, when it was
discovered that the people who make Duncan Hines cake mix were putting
a lot of ethylene dibromide (EDB) into the cake mix to suppress weevils.
This is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic.
The guy who represented the company in the press conference defended
himself by saying that the risk from eating Duncan Hines products every day
for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal-
broiled steaks.  What a great analogy!  When I first heard that, my
immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit!  One charcoal
broiled steak would be equivalent to 0.5 Duncans!

First I've heard of it. Offhand:

Griffin is no longer an ""office"" head, so that's bad.

On the other hand:

Regress seemed to think: we can't fund anything by Griffin, because
that would mean (and we have the lies by the old hardliners about the
$ 400 billion mars mission to prove it) that we would be buying into a
mission to Mars that would cost 400 billion. Therefore there will be
no Artemis or 20 million dollar lunar orbiter et cetera...

They were killing Griffin's main program simply because some sycophants
somewhere had Congress beleivin that to do so would simply be to buy into
the same old stuff. Sorta like not giving aid to Yeltsin because he's
a communist hardliner.

At least now the sort of reforms Griffin was trying to bring forward
won't be trapped in their own little easily contained and defunded
ghetto. That Griffin is staying in some capacity is very very very
good. And if he brings something up, noone can say ""why don't you go
back to the OSE where you belong"" (and where he couldn't even get money
for design studies).

Is Kratz claiming that he can reliably visually distinguish an M-16
from an AR-15?  That he can see the difference between a semi-auto and
a full-auto UZI?  That he can see the difference between the various
versions (some full-auto, some semi-auto only) of the M-11/9?

If so, I'd love to hear the details, if only because they'll demonstrate
that Kratz is blowing smoke.

Considering that one can design a gun so that it looks just like
another gun, yet have very different properties, and that that's
quite common....

Most kids in my neighborhood were quite young when they figured out
that my parents car wasn't much like Richard Petty's, even though it
looked just like it (except for the paint job).  Things must have been
different with Kratz.

>Sure it's on TV but why does that make a difference?

No, it doesn't, but that's irrelevant.  If visual inspection of the

Acronym List for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle:
Edition 8, 1992 Dec 7
Last posted: 1992 Aug 27

This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing
acronyms in the space-related newsgroups.  If I forgot or botched your
favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not*
on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure
it out, I'll add it to the list.

Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*
acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated
every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)

The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All
comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.

Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your
own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of
acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that
are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.
Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of
the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply
different ways of referring to the same thing.

Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of
the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),
who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in
character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),
who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and
terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).

Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA
Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and
Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly
mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.

Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program
written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the
acronym list in an entertaining fashion.  Thanks, Larry!

I thought Bill James' latest book completely and totally sucked.  I bought
it, but will not purchase anything of his ever again without THOROUGHLY
looking at it first.  What tripe.

The book is inconsistent, and filled with selective analysis.  James
claims to be looking forward, and then makes some absolutely bizarre
statements of value.  Not only that, but I got the impression he
probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name
on it. 

To say I was disappointed is a grand understatement.

Well, I never wrote that I would act as you described.  I stated that I 
would not block a would-be passer.  I would not block a would-be passer
""for their own good"" or for any reason other than I was prevented from 
doing so due to the traffic circumstance.  I fail to see how deterring a
passer under these circumstance would IN ANY WAY decrease YOUR chances
of being involved in an accident, fatal or otherwise.  In fact, I could
imagine how blocking a would-be passer would actually INCREASE your 
chances of being ""offed"" or involved in an accident, especially if 
this ""passer"" is riding your bumper.  Intentionally blocking a person
riding your bumper is certainly NOT a ""wise driving practice"", it 
only causes the jam to become more congested. 
 
I don't mess with trucks and I actually watch the road ahead AND the 
road behind!   If I perceive that I am rapidly closing on a ""pack"" 
of vehicles, I try to avoid getting caught up in situation such as you 
decribe.  Usually either traffic is just building and I have to deal 
with this fact of life, or I wait to a slow passer to complete their 
pass and make way for the pack to clear.  If someone decides then to 
pull up on my bumper, I signal my intention to move to the right, and 
do so at the first opportunity (& hope they will open the jam).  I 
feel this is not only courteous driving, but ALOT safer than the 
actions you advocate!!!  There are actually many courteous drivers 
on the road who do not intentionally impede others.  

If someone in front of me seems to be oblivious to the fact that they 
are blocking traffic I use my blinker or flash my lights, or, if all 
else fails, will briefly speed up /slow down so they MIGHT get the 
message that I am a faster vehicle trying to pass.  I feel it is never 
safe to ride anyone's bumper.  IF someone is intentionally blocking 
traffic, because they feel that it is civil duty or philosophic duty 
or for some unfathomable reason, I feel they deserve, at the very least,
derision.       (Sorry this is soooooooo long.)

Condo sleeps 6-8 depending on how friendly you all are.  Has hot tub,
deck.  Easy access to parking lot and shuttle to slopes (condo is a few
miles from the slopes).

Cost: $6000 OBRO, price based on what we paid for it (used, also) and
current market.

Subject: Orion drive in vacuum -- how?
Organization: UUNET Technologies Inc, Falls Church, VA, USA

NNTP-Posting-Host: mimi.uu.net


  Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It
would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.
The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to
ten megatons yield behind a ""pusher plate"" attached to the main
spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer
momentum to the ship.

  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion
heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave
into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are
going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,
helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic
radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission
products).

  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much
momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems
to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs
out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once
they're there.

  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?

  Thanks.

	What's the difference between Nolan Ryan and Yount?  Both have hung
around for years, and continue to post great stats.  Why shouldn't Dave Kingman
get into the Hall?  Or Murray, Evens, Reardon, and others?  What the hell do
you have to do?  Ask an opposing pitcher whether he thinks that Winfield should
be in the hall...  God.  Pretty soon you'll be saying that Cal Ripken doesn't
deserve to be in the Hall.  Then, I'll flame you. :-)

Wow.  I was beginning to think that I had made that up.  I remember that
movie (it was about 1.5 hours long).  I don't think they ended up anywhere
in the known universe.  

I remember they got a message halfway out to Proxima Centauri, that Earth
transmitted a day after they launched, timed to catch up with them at the
halfway point.  I thought it was neat, I think I was all of 10 at the time.

I will look for the Into Infinity show, I never did know that was the
name of it, I thought the show was called ""the day after tomorrow"", and
that was it.

Because most of the children were with their parent(s). Do you understand

One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
you may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a ""turn off"" command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can
no longer be turned off.

|Question #2

|As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.
|Is there any way to get around this provision?

Why don't you call the City and ask? Oak Park also has an illegal handgun
ban as well, but does allow those with a ""collectors FFL"" to possess
(""collectible?"") handguns.

|What would the penalty if you were found out be?

Probably a fine in practical terms.

|What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment 
|there?  How would the city law apply to your impending 
|trial for the shooting?

It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident
in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a
handgun; the grand jury decided not to presecute. On the other hand,
a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend
himself, and the Village tried to make an example out of him. An NRA
Director who lived there made a stink about this, and it was decided
not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs
has it's own drawbacks, like when the Oak Park Police Chief came to his
house, and told him: ""this is stepping over the line; this could get
dangerous for you."" Whereupon the few black Oak Park police officers
watched over his house to ensure that the white anti-gun police chief
and his anti-gun cronies wouldn't f*ck with him, his home or family.

|Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled
|shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, 
|either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).  

L.V. Cipriani states that the ""Any other weapon"" category is allowed,
but the exact relationship between an Ithaca Auto-burgular, which I
believe is in the ""Any other weapon"" category and a chopped barrel
H&K HK-94 (Class 3 for sure) is not clear to me...

|One more thing, what is the chance of getting a CCW permit in IL without being
|rich or famous or related to the mayor?

In your dreams, buddy. As long as Democrats reign in Chicago, Illinois
residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets. Politicians
get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry
concealed weapons. Voters in Chicago are too stupid to vote these a**holes
out of office; because the Dems are always in power, the Illinois 
Supreme Court is always tilted to the Democratic Party's views on guns.
[All candidates supported by political consultant David Axelrod are
anti-gun, which explains anti-RKBA Crook County States Attorney 
Jack(ass) O'Malley being a so-called ""Republican.""]

Get rid of the Chicago Democrats, get rid of their members on the IL
Judiciary, and you got a fighting chance of a preemption law and a CCW
law...

Now my comments: 

I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - 
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife.  

The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. 

Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live 
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport 
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels 
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, 
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - 
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch 
commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, 
truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  
If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at 
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  

To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage 
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 
8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the 
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it 
if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could 
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky 
while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that 
as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, 
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.

Wm. Hathaway

	Actually, this started as a great idea.  Before steering-column

	Also, suppose you get into your car, and a thug comes up and
demands your keys at gunpoint.  You hand them over, he gets in, and
HAS NO IDEA WHERE TO PUT THE KEY!  At this, he will run away (or perhaps
shoot you anyway  %-}).  I heard this actually happened somewhere...
	Btw, I hear that the Saab 900's new successor will have the
ignition on the console, between the seats, where it belongs.

the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence
(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault
a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting
negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms
and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have
very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the
child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco
issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with
no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then
the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent
in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,
murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend
the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the 
public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault
on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,
the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for
BATF wrongdoing.

btw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.

Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When
graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,
presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the
area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft
doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes
'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)
envelope'. 

Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually
flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are
are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots
do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the
correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in
essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where
the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is
done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally
carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how
far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,
such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed
taxi tests).

I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about
this process (and then some).

Not to mention last year's Weaver affair.

Anyway, here's how I see the Waco affair; I'd be interested in other peoples'
interpretations...

1. Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business.
2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldn't have
   disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However, I think
   the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style
   assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other
   noncombatants.
3. I don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait
   the BDs out; I don't approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused
   the fire to be started, I think the FBI agent responsible should spend
   10-20 years in jail.
4. However, if Koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,
   I hold him largely responsible for their deaths.

What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of
had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the
compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.

	If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the
	warrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they
	wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,
	Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been
	able to have told such heroic stories about how they
	""protected"" the rest of us from a group of people who
	kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.

The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored
transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use
more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to
do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they
must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.

	The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group
	of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.

With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed
more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is
the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country.

	Well, I figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by
	everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement, so I'll
	just let it pass for now.

	Case Western reserve, huh?  Do the Feds know about that big 
	stockpile of automatic weapons and crack you have in  your
	house?  Are you the same Daniel Oldham that lives on Orchard
	Drive?  Just so they get the address right, that is...

Look
at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country
of ours.

	Well, it used to be a great country.  Now I'm not so sure.  
	I knew a few of those good people who died in wars;  I was
	in Viet Nam.  I can assure you, none of us fought to protect
	the right of the government to attack its own citizens with
	military force without provocation.  (Hint: serving a search warrant
	is NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault
	on a religious group.  At Least not here in the US.  Maybe in
	Iraq, or Syria...)

With the arms build up in Waco they needed to hit that compound with
mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few
women and kids but it would of been better then letting them all burn
to death 51 days later.

	This is a joke, right?  Or are they really letting fools like
	you into CWRU now?  Too bad. Used to be a good school.  How'd you
	get in anyway, did your old man buy a new wing for the library?

an excellent automatic can be found in the subaru legacy.  it switches to
""sport"" mode when the electronics figure it,  not when the driver sets
the switch.. which is the proper way to do it, IMO.  so what does ""sport""
mode entail?  several things:

1) revving to red line (or to the rev limiter in the case of the legacy)

2) delayed upshifts.  (i.e. if you lift off briefly, it will remain in the
	low gear.  this is handy if you are charging through corners and
	would like to do without the distraction of upshifts when there's
	another curve approaching)

3) part throttle downshifts, based on the *speed* at which the pedal is
	depressed, rather than the *position* of the pedal.  modern
	electronics can measure this very easily and switch to sport mode.
	this is wonderful if you want to charge through a green light about
	to turn red.  my audi senses this very well and can downshift on as
	little as half throttle if my right foot is fast enough.

also, i think that a smart automatic can deliver better gas mileage
than a dumb driver with a stick, all else being equal.. remember that
the idea of a stick being more economical than an automatic makes a
big assumption that the driver is smart enough to know what gear to
use for each situation.. how many times have you ridden with an
inattentive driver cruising on the highway at 55/65 in 4th gear (of a
5 speed)?  

how many % of people who drive manuals *really* know what the best
gear to use is for every conceivable situation?  i'm sure there will
be some who know, but i suspect that a chip controlled automatic with
all possible scenario/ratio combinations stored in ROM is likely to do
better.  i can also say that all my previous assumptions were proved
wrong after i got a car with instantaneous mpg readout... high gear,
low revs and wide open throttle is more economical than low gear, high
revs and small throttle opening.  the explanation is quite simple if
one sits down to think about it, but not that obvious at first sight.

             The Lunar Tele-operation Model One (LTM1)
             =========================================
                        By David H. Mitchell
                          March 23, 1993
 
INTRODUCTION:
 
In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a
real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test
tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals
located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment
purposes.
Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and
tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of
information
on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of
a
lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating
educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and
achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in
Twenty-First century remote learning methods.
 
Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests
and
skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,
interfacing
and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving
playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and
professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at
a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at
the
LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real
facility
exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the
construction
of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested
by the users themselves.
 
This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:
 - tele-operations and virtual reality research
 - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation
 - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers
 - art and theater
 - bbs and online network users
 - software and game developers
 - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains
 - children
 - the child in all of us
 
LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:
 
A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used
for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.
The ""floor"" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions
is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and
creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and
machine-lets.
 
 The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:
 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;
 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and
 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.
 
 Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on
 it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture
 content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent
 to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.
 
The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains
with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control
electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will
receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their
data link to LTM1.
 
Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a
servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the
SSTO
to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar
landscape and land.
 
Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped
bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators
worldwide
to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and
takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on
commercially
available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the
interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced
ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.
 
By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding
a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be
provided in under 80 man hours.
 
PLAN OF ACTION:
 
The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by
providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network.
Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction
of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be
modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide ""rail stock""
for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical
communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.
An initial ""ground breaking"" with miniature shovels will be performed for
a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial
models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for
historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely
serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional
building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and
the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution
world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be
issued
calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale
models
for the simulated lunar colony.
 
A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then
be
announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to
find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of
the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that
time
the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will
then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return
to
their campus.
 
A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via
conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment
addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.
Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo
opportunity for the television community. Especially since the ""action""
will
be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be
invited to issue ""challenges"" to engineering and human factors students at
universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform
lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be
simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.
 
The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,
experimentation
and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a
long
term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic
example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited
to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can
lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!
 
CONCLUSION:
 
EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has
ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a
globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation
purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create
world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require
real
(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in
space.

No, obviously talking about Research Assistants.  I favor a high protein,
low fat diet, barely adequate salary on a fixed time schedule, four hours
of sleep a night, continuous infusion of latte, unpredictable praise 
mixed randomly with anxiety-provoking, everpresent glances with 
lowered eyebrows, unrealistic promises of rapid publication, and 
every three months a dinner consisting of nothing but microbrewery ale
and free pretzels.  Actually, mine hails from San Diego, and indeed 
has more problems in Seattle in cold weather than in warm.

Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all NL players with at
least 10 at-bats.

It is early in the season so there are some high numbers.  Barry Bonds
finished last season at 0.795.

I welcome comments and suggestions.

	Several chemists already have come up with several substitutes for
R12.  You don't hear about them because the Mobile Air Conditioning Society
(MACS), that is, the people who stand to rake in that $300 to $1000 per
retrofit per automobile, have mounted an organized campaign to squash those
R12 substitutes out of existence if not ban them altogether (on very shaky
technical grounds, at best, on outright lies at worst).

	Does this piss you off?  Yes?  Write a letter to your congressman, to
your senator, to the president, to the EPA, and to the DOT and complain.

Probably because there are many children there.  Also the minor fact
that other than defending themselves from 100 some people attacking them
they haven't threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in
years.  Being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds
for a mass murder of Koresh and his followers.

I'm not sure there's a really sharp distinction between allergic and
vasomotor rhinitis.  Basically, vasomotor rhinitis means your nose is
stuffy when it has no reason to be (not even an identifiable allergy).

Decongestants and steroid sprays work for vasomotor rhinitis.  Also,
I can get surprising relief from purely superficial measures such as
saline moisturizing spray and moisturizing gel.

The Command Loss Timer is part of the fault protection scheme of the
spacecraft.  If the Command Loss Timer ever countdowns to zero, then the
spacecraft assumes it has lost communications with Earth and will go 
through a set of predetermined steps to try to regain contact.  The
Command Loss Timer is set to 264 hours and reset about once a week during 
the cruise phase, and is set to a lower value during an encounter phase.

I saw a Lifetime Medical Television show a few months back on travel
medicine.  It briefly mentioned some drugs which when started two or
three days before getting to altitude could assist in acclimitazation.

Unfortunately all that I can recall is that the drug stimulated
breathing at night???  I don't know if that makes sense, it seems
to me that the new drug which stimulates red blood cell production
would be a more logical approach, erythropoiten (sp?).

Alas, I didn't record the program, but wish I had, since I live
at over 7000ft. and my mother gets sick when visiting.

Please let me know if you get more informative responses.

   As I live in Sweden I remember the day perfectly well. We changed
side 1967-09-03 (or 03-SEP-1967). I don't remeber the exactly time but
it was in the night. (in the 'big' cities like Stockholm & Gothenburg
all trafic was forbidden, exept busses and taxis, during the whole
weekend.) The day was a Sunday and everything was prepared in before.

Before the day we was told to follow the yellow lines on the road and
after it was the white one that matters. The signs with arrows on was
prepared with a 'left mode' label that was torn off that night to
reveal the new right mode arrow.

The year after Iceland also changed.

About cars: Before the H-day (H as in ""Hoegertrafik"". ""hoeger"" is
Swedish and stands for 'right') practically all cars already had their
steering wheels on the left side. Even the imported cars from UK had
the wheel on 'the right side'. At last we have cars with the wheels on
the right side. :-)

More contries that uses the left side is:

Japan
Tanzania (I think)
New Zeeland
How about South Africa?

BTW. Some sais that the left side is the right side because Ivanhoe
and other knights meet at the left when they fight in tournaments. :-)

Some other owners on the ford-probe@world.std.com mailing list have commented 
about this problem, but I haven't seen it happen on my 3 month old 
'93 Probe GT.  I think this may be something that Ford has corrected since 
the initial batch of cars.  Also, someone said that Ford has issued a 
service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem, so you 
may be able to get your dealer to fix it.

Haven't seen any of these problems, nor have I seen these mentioned on the

No problems like these either.  I haven't been able to find any obvious 
places where they screwed up.

Hmmm!  I got two keys with my car.  Something tells me you got stiffed by
your dealer on this.  (Actually, if you count the ""credit card"" key that 
came in the owner's binder, I got 3 keys, but since the credit card key

The latter is probably because of the air bag.  It's pretty much takes up
all the space where you'd expect to find the horn.

Speaking of the horn, I was surprised to find that the Probe comes with one
of those nice 'merican sounding horns instead of the Japanese sounding kind.
The previous Probes had Japanese horns.

Yeah, not very badly, but enough to be annoying sometimes.

I agree strongly with all of the above, especially about the engine.  The
interior is very, very nice too.  Very pleasing to the eye, and ergonomically
sound.

Yes, this car's stiff suspension isn't for everyone.  I personally like it,
but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car, I'd strongly
suggest looking into the MX-6.

The problem with the back seat is that there's no leg room.  Plenty of 
head room, though.  Shorter people fit back there without any complaints,
so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to 
give them a place to put their feet.

The power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car. :-)
I really enjoy the moonroof, by the way, but then I've always been a sucker
for open air driving.  No leakage problems or anything like that...yet!

>I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.

I haven't heard about this one.  I know that some of the very early Probes
('89 and maybe '90) had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers (which
Ford will replace at no charge), but I haven't heard about anything like
this concerning the '93 Probes.

I haven't had any real trouble with this car outside of a CV joint boot
that was leaking, but the dealer took care of that promptly, and even
gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that I was without my
car.  I was quite happy with the way they handled...especially considering
that I was expecting the worst from them!

From what I've heard, it sounds like Ford/Mazda had some QC problems with 
the Probe (and probably MX-6) when they first went into production, but 
I think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point.  That's
almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this, though.

Hope this helps,

PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS

    This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes
    (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew
    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on
    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material
    posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).

US PLANETARY MISSIONS


    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)

    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed
    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground
    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the
    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in
    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the
    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed
    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a
    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted
    from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative
    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations
    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.

    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December
    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a
    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world
    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide
    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).

    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective
    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary
    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar
    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in
    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.

    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and
    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it
    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere
    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from
    this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the
    geological and biological sense.

    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that
    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information
    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times
    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface
    of an ocean.

    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work
    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away
    the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic
    measurements of MARINER 4.

    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket
    launcher autopilot failed.

    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to
    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no
    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian
    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once
    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup
    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.

    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe
    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in
    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,
    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four
    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974
    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed
    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than
    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which
    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.


    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)

    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph
    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide
    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new
    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft
    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on
    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.

    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first
    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally
    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead
    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to
    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6
    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,
    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would
    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.

    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER
    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to
    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through
    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever
    to do so.

    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER
    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made
    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus
    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere
    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the
    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the
    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day
    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before
    its batteries failed.


    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)

    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They
    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems
    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.

    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an
    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the
    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.
    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the
    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.

    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but
    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,
    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.

    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost
    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon
    and drifted off into solar orbit.

    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send
    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact
    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras
    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first
    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.


    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)

    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image
    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO
    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our
    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.
    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were
    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.
    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar
    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.


    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)

    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar
    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the
    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered
    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing
    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was
    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.

    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the
    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images
    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from
    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,
    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored
    the Tycho crater region in 1968.


    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)

    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on
    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June
    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse
    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for
    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes
    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of
    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was
    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is
    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the
    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and
    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.

    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran
    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a
    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep
    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command
    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until
    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the
    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.

    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the
    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the
    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,
    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until
    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.

    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit
    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in
    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its
    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording
    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in
    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut
    down on April 12, 1980.

    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.


    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)

    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March
    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched
    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,
    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and
    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare
    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to
    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,
    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.

    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their
    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered
    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and
    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major
    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous
    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.

    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets
    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep
    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive
    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle
    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was
    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.
    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,
    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.

    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,
    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly
    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was
    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational
    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on
    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10
    satellites and one more ring were discovered.

    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,
    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright
    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were
    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a
    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)

    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their
    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets
    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the
    location of the heliopause.


SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS

    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and
    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:


    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES

    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first
	     craft in solar orbit.
    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.
    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.
    ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was
	     also a test for future Mars missions.
    LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images
	     from surface.
    LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966.

	     unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle.
    LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil
	      to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in
	      1972.
    LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's
	      surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished

    LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in
	      1976.


    SOVIET VENUS PROBES

    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions
	       lost enroute in 1961.
    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with
	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in
	       February of 1966. No images were returned.
    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.
	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe
	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.
    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending
	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before
	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles
	       similar in 1969.
    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet
	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in
	       1972.
    VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the
	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar
	       mission.
    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.
		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.
    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of
		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.
    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian
	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on
	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in
	     March of 1986.


    SOVIET MARS PROBES

    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased
	     enroute the following year.
    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian
	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.
    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian
	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red
	     Planet in 1971.
    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander
	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.
    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to
	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.
    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in
	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.
	     probe MARINER 9.
    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.
    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit
	     with its flyby bus.
    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest
	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to
	       human/computer error.
    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did
	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week
	       before scheduled Phobos landing.

    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even
    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have
    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,
    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a
    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been
    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now
    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their
    space program remains to be seen.


JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS

    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on
    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km
    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to
    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of
    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on
    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest
    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The
    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for
    a Japanese spacecraft.

    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail
    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby
    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third
    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).


    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,
    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten
    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first
    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget
    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.

    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An
    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists
    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March
    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The
    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt
    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.

    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and
    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten
    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,
    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and
    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into
    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the
    approach:

	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km
	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km
	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)
	Period		: 4.7 days


PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES

    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three
    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,
    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means
    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your
    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can
    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.

    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it
    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in
    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in
    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date
    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra
    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good
    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works
    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market
    bookstore.

    Other works and periodicals:

    NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space
    probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry
    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission
    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study
    some of the books listed above.

    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL
    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's
    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,
    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER
    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the
    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions
    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and
    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major
    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,
    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events
    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are
    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you
    probably know.

    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you
    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space
    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their
    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe
    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,
    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.

    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I
    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas
    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from
    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

the Indians.  But objectively, Alomar had the better offensive year

You admit T&P as a reliable(?), objective source?  Then you will note
that they rated Alomar as the better offensive player, chosing Baerga
over Alomar only because of his defense.

That's a joke!  (Alomar might not be a gold-glover, but he's certainly
no worse than Baerga defensively.)

Phenylketonuria is a disease in which the body cannot process phenylalanine.
It can build up in the blood and cause seizures and neurological damage.
An odd side effect is that the urine can be deeply colored, like red wine.
People with the condition must avoid Nutrasweet, chocolate, and anything
else rich in phenylalanine.

Aspartame is accused of having caused various vague neurological symptoms.
Pat Robertson's program _The_700_Club_ was beating the drum against
aspartame rather vigorously for about a year, but that issue seems to
have been pushed to the back burner for the last year or so.  Apparently,
the evidence is not very strong, or Pat would still be flailing away.

Listen: thrush is a recognized clinical syndrome with definite
characteristics.  If you have thrush, you have thrush, because you can
see the lesions and do a culture and when you treat it, it generally
responds well, if you're not otherwise immunocompromised.  Noring's
anal-retentive idee fixe on having a fungal infection in his sinuses
is not even in the same category here, nor are these walking neurasthenics
who are convinced they have ""candida"" from reading a quack book.

    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're
  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own
  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps
  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,
  ""bullshit filters"".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.
  
Later in the same post:
     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building
  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and
  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.

Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are
""inclined"" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those
claims are still ludicrous, however.

Previously Awesley had written:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

Prompting me to write:
  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

To which Awesley replied:
  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.

But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the
notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion
because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But
that too is ludicrous.

I wrote:
  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been
  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about
  it. 

Awesley relied:
     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an
  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it
  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an
  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged
  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.
  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but

  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
  assert that I claimed they were truth.

Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. 
Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's
without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on
it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying
""this has gone far enough.""  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis
for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. 
Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and
everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it
had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own
research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is
extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. 
Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I
do not.

I don't know where you live, but I couldn't get out of my driveway
at night without reverse lights. As someone said, out in the country
you notice neat little things like stars and the difference between
day and night. At night around my house (which is amongst a forest of
rather tall oaks) it is DARK, except for nights with full moons.
Reverse lights illuminate my path very well when backing up; I greatly
prefer cars with them to cars without operational reverse lights.

I just got through listening to the 10 o'clock news on Channel 4 here in
Dallas. They trotted out a list of justifications produced by the ATF after
""months of investigation"" for their raid. 

I couldn't believe the junk on this list! For example, the BDs were accused
of stockpiling a bunch of ""9mm and .223 ammunition that can be used in M15
and M16 assault rifles"". Imagine that--they had ammunition!  They also had
aluminum dust! (Yeah, it's a component of thermite, but so far I haven't
heard that it's illegal to take a grinder to the aluminum lawn
furniture...) The only thing on the list that could conceivably have been
illegal was an M-79 grenade launcher. (Anybody know about this?)

Months of investigation! For this 80+ people died!

I'm not sure about that.  Did you see the ""poll"" they took that showed
that most people thought physicians should be paid $80,000 per year
tops?  That's all I make, but I doubt that most physicians are going
to work very hard for that kind of bread.  Many wouldn't be able

	I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space
limitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to
those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at
what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the
endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility
of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and
draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental
flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing
the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.
Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault
rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has
only range and acurracy going for it.

>They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to

	I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much
more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word
would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this
is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change
quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians
intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The
balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.

	That seems to be the case already, given that heavy
weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low
numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior
weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically
superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training
includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,
whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.

	I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers
of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the
heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman
tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders
from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,
though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should
therefore be jointly maintained and operated.

	This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control
over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state
to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that
the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,
I would have to assume that State control would rest on the
authority of the Governor and militia officers.

	I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,
fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few
people with government support.  Just as you argued above that
the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control
so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this
situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding
all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.
I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that
the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the
unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.

	We have to assume that there would be those who would
side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all
the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.
I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the
local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their
armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the
tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.
I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.

>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds

	So would I, but the resources often aren't available to
outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to
call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster
than anything else.

>Perhaps the National Guard isn't as close to my conception of
>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to 
>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry
>arm of the regular army.

	Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think
main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up
field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton
trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff
of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units
in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.

	Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy
equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light
stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the
states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local
ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,
hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,
the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for
other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a
very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias
for these functions.

[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]

Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day
with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.
It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,
whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from
wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.

Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to
remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been
checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the
people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of
""election fraud"" to hold their jobs.

Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and
sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and
telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too
many cases, who they were).

Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and
discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a
delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater
of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was
being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or
ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.

The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner
Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's
hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive
husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole
our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an
inadequate hearing room.

One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.
He said, ""Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is
always so organized every year.""  I got a little pissed, and replied,
""I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.""

At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a
demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the
pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his
mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and
several Simon's Rock anti-gun ""close-the-loophole"" protestors.
(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)

The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were
about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers
from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got
closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A
cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the
crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker
was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.

Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet
saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up
to ""support GOAL's position"" on ""all bills.""

First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to
testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students
had some curfew, I guess).  

Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long
guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of
his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to
non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock
folks called the current law a ""loophole"" and wanted it closed.

Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his ""SKS assault rifle.""
The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well
that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,
and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery
corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed
that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was
lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining
states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state ""as strong as""
that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.

Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  ""In some of
these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!""
(Oooooo!)  ""We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if
only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't
be having this situation -- but they won't.""  (Naughty, naughty!)

Next up was Boston city councilman Albert ""Dapper"" O'Neill.  He was
there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's
reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's
almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the
ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were
judge, he'd give arrestees their ""last rights"" (pun intended) on the
spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)
He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the
right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(

Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a
CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a
restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining
order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction
-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor
of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,
""I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to
get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have
convicted.""  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous
performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.

Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable
every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated
purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.
""Revenue has nothing to do with it.""  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some
congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that
it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the
vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn
card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the
law-abiding instead of the crook.

The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.
Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both ""restraining
order"" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any
bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He 
was a co-sponsor of one of the ""restraining order"" bills as well.)  One
of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was
vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in
the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, ""every
year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...""
It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been
more effective.

At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.
Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because
the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was
disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had
to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the ""public""
testimony; the other got a seat this time.

Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the
state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.
He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that
his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great
quote: ""If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state
computer system until 1999.""  (This was also an argument he used
against the renewable FID card.)

Testimony was heard from several ""battered women,"" one of whom had
been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he
got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and
said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General
Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how
50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women
needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was
granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether
the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be
satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather
than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long
rambling circumlocution in response.

Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks
something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining
orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue
restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they
think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining
orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.
Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.

Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a
restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she
countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have
allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.
One of the junior reps noted that ""this is America"" and we have to be
certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga
reiterated this, saying that ""people who abuse smaller people can go
to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating
conviction with a restraining order.""  (Point and match, Senator.)

Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his
citizenship ""expired every 5 years,"" and that a driver's license was a
privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.

A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice
system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public
hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death
penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public
hangings.  The speaker then responded, ""I'll make you a deal.  You get
me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.""

Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher
testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that ""he
wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was
outside"" without his evil gun.  She said that the ""loophole"" should be
closed to prevent something like this from ""ever happening again"".

Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of
spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually
shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,
saying, ""As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are
safe -- support gun control.""  The committee was reluctant to grill or
correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had
claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  ""Only residents can get
FID's,"" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no
idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut
out-of-staters completely off?)

Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as
written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by
out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could
be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary
somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino
underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident
student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental
record.

One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy
a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was ""elitist"".  Another
(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents
from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union
had ""FID-type"" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home
state was ""not enough.""  One pro-gun speaker replied that this
resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,
""Everyone's out of step but Johnny!""

All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony
for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the
other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and
GOAL's position) were:

o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull 
   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)

o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)

o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly
   opposed)

o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws 
   (opposed)

o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)

o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)

o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)

o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)

o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)

Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining
pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.

Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger
lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee
to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.

Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.
Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,
""This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.""

The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it
could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It
ended at about 6:30.

Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with
nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?

Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good.  I use the phrase ""happened to be"" advisedly.
Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to ""turn it up a notch"" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an
ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who
tend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base
end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position.

I agree.

Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):

There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its
rings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here's some
information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay
Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to
learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have
some money available...

John Spencer, 1993/04/21

Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn
itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,
(21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;

     1993 May 1-2

        A-ring ingress  18:27
               egress   19:30
        B-ring ingress  19:51
               egress   21:42
        C-ring egress   23:00
        Saturn ingress  23:59
               egress   10:02
        B-ring ingress  10:28
               egress   12:19
        A-ring ingress  12:40
               egress   13:43

     1993 July 20-21

        Saturn ingress  21:16
               egress   05:08
        A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)
               egress   09:38

Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,
and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'
orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from
Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about
the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy
and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell
of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my
attention.

THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?

Jay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:

  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July
  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,
  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,
  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3
  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with
  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something
  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.

  Jay

and again:

  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet
  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would
  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and
  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a
  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't
  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are
  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One
  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.

>>Now.  The Braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid

	This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the
SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how
important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls
in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher's rank in ""defense"".  

	Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves
(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I
can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics
(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions
at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  

	All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and
Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn
the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to
learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't
be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over
pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But 
given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.

	Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league
pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring
problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he
can't learn just as well while in the majors?

No, he does not exclusively treat LD patients.  However, in some parts of the
country, you don't need to be known as an LD ""specialist"" to see a large
number of LD patients walk through your office.  Given the huge problem of
underdiagnosis, orthopedists encounter late manifestations of the disease just
about every day in their regular practices.  Dr. N. told me that last year,
he sent between 2 and 5 patients a week to the LD specialists... and he is not
the only orthopedists in the town.

Let's say that only 2 people per week actually have LD.  That means at the
*very minimum* 104 people in our town (and immediate area) develop late stage
manifestations of LD *every year*.  Add in the folks who were diagnosed by
neurologists, rheumatologists, GPs, etc, and you can see what kind of problem
we have.  No wonder just about everybody in town personally knows an LD
patient.

He refers most patients to LD specialists, but in extreme cases he puts the
patient on medication immediately to minimize the damage (in most cases, to
the knees).

Gordon is correct when he states that most LD specialists are GPs.

Folks,

Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal
carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled ""Armed Force.""  I
felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat
that ""A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.""  I sent
the following to the WSJ.

-----

Gun Stats & Mortal Risks

Preston K. Covey


	Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~
2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns
in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King
County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more
likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to
kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it
has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated
by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of
the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine
(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping
firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ 
 
	Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of
bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: 
What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither
the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the
risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control
do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of
cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the
risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful
here. 

	The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us
off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a
misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice
and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far
outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your
car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or
an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not
take the bus?  

	Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company
of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at
stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:

	The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the
number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense
(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed
by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation
is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other
cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12
accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided
by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King
County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of
homes unaccounted.

	The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on
six counts:

	1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or
acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and
neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is
that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,
dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,
but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are
relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the
calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless
Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is
criminological hogwash.

	2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs
populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories
-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited
by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities
like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is
very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but
avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with
histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and
certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious
risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as
ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither
gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or
vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver
crucially affect the risk. 

	3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is
that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill
than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of
personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike
Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43
times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this
particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about
whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by
tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question
begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any
case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal
instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths
are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility
obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by
gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to
NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. 
People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their
homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection
course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and
sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death
as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard
and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they
disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and
other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we
resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose
norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign
us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in
the matter.

	4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the
NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,
including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total
death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other
studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from
homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these
suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true
that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously
true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these
suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of
research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is
wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce
L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,
1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of
Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of
the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to
~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the
causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a
profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally
disregard this issue.

	5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable
rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the
NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. 
But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled
self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case
dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of
justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story
on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women
who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,
1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic
cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were
reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported
that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In
Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error
by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged
by promulgators of the NEJM statistic. 

	6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation
are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The
divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not
aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even
shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the
coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy
is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure
the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as
opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or
deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where
no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed
to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the
compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by
criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,
Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?
	Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are
based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is
high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare
better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance
or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year
by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and
accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable
statistic than the NEJM scare stat:  

A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or
other crime than to kill anybody.   

	Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;
what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We
should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation
of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. 
Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by
uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we
can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we
hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.

No, you just miss the point.  By your methods, I can prove gun control to be a  
total failure.  New York's total homocide count, with it's strict gun control,  
is MUCH higher than Rhode Island's, with it's less strict gun control.  FAR  
more folks are killed in New York, than Rhode Island.  Therefore, according to  
Mane Logic(tm), gun control has made New York a much more dangerous place than  
Rhode Island.  Remember, it's ""Nitpicking"" and ""a whiney debating style"" to  
point out the differences between New York and Rhode Island that might defeat  
my argument.

No. reverse lights are to warn others that you are backing up. They

Well, red and orange were already taken. Maybe white defines the direction
that the car is moving in.


If you really want to be able to see behind you, get some fog lamps for
the back of the car. These work very well - and are a good way to get
rid of tailgaters if you get that rush of testosterone.

I like my power windows. I think they're worth it.

However, cruise control is a pretty dumb option. What's the point?
If you're on a long trip, you floor the gas and keep your eyes on
the rear-view mirror for cops, right?

Power seats are pretty dumb too, unless you're unlucky enough to have
to share your car. Otherwise, you'd just adjust it once and just leave
it like that.

Such a measure would also have another benefit. It would relieve the
various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds
of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. I'm
sure that, to attain sure a lofty, humane, liberal and ecologically
(not to mention politically) correct goal, the environmental and animal
rights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more than
willing to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased
taxation to replace these lost revenues. I am equally confident that
these same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social
responsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally
and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the
hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands
solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). To
do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in
the ethically untenable (to say nothing of environmentally and
politically incorrect) position of sanctioning the logging and
subsequent development and urbanization of these former private
hunting lands, which would no longer be useable by, or of any
benefit to, the landowner(s) in such a capacity.
